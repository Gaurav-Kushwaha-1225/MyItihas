///
/// IMPORTANT: Password Recovery Flow
/// ================================
/// When a user clicks a password reset link, Supabase PKCE automatically creates
/// and persists a session. This is problematic because:
/// 1. The user gets "logged in" before resetting their password
/// 2. They can access authenticated routes without completing password reset
/// 3. The session persists across hot restarts
///
/// Solution: Use `isRecovering` flag to override normal authentication routing.
/// - When password recovery deep link is detected, `isRecovering` is set to true
/// - GoRouter treats recovery state as HIGHER PRIORITY than authenticated state
/// - Recovery state forces navigation to /reset-password regardless of session
/// - After successful password update, sign out the recovery session and clear flag
