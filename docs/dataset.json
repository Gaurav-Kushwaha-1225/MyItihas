        "story": "It was the time of sunrise, at Badarik\u0101\u015brama, in the area of the Himalayas. Sage Vy\u0101sa just took his bath in River Sarasvati. Then, he offered his prayers and sat alone to meditate. Being a great saint of spiritual vision, he could see the past and the future with his divine eyes. It was the end of Dv\u0101para yuga. Kali-yuga was approaching soon. In his meditation, Vy\u0101sadeva saw various faults in the people to be born in Kali-yuga. Vy\u0101sadeva is an incarnation of Lord \u015ar\u012b Krsna. Desiring to benefit people, he thought, The people of Kali-yuga will have less lifespan, short memory, and poor intelligence. The Vedas contain great knowledge that gives the right direction to humanity. So, I will give them the knowledge of the Vedas in a simplified form. Vy\u0101sa then planned to write the Vedas. Previously there were no books. People used to learn simply by hearing from a powerful guru, and they would remember easily. This is because they had sharp intelligence and good memory. But people of Kali-yuga have poor memory. So, Vy\u0101sadeva wanted to put the Vedic knowledge in written form to benefit humanity in Kali-yuga. At the beginning of the creation, Lord Brahm\u0101 spoke the four Vedas with his four mouths. The mantras of these Vedas were mixed like an unsorted collection of various types of gems. Together they were known as one Veda named Yajur-Veda. Vy\u0101sadeva separated these Vedic mantras into four divisions, just as one sorts out a diverse collection of jewels into various piles according to their color or size. These divisions are the four Vedas -Rg Veda, Yajur Veda, S\u0101ma Veda, and Atharva Veda. Thereafter Vyasa had written the Puranas and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to teach morals to human beings through stories. Thus, the histories and stories in the Puranas are called the fifth Veda. Vy\u0101sa then instructed his disciples, Please become professors of the Vedas and propagate this wisdom Sage Paila took charge of the Rg Veda, Jaimini S\u0101ma Veda, Vai\u015bamp\u0101yana - Yajur Veda, Sumantu Atharva-Veda, and Romaharsana took charge of the Puranas. These scholars divided the Vedas into smaller sections and spread that excellent knowledge through their disciples and grand disciples.",

As the yugas change from the first to the last, there will be degradation in people's mentalities and habits.

        "title": "From Confusion to Clarity",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 1",
        "story": "Why is my heart dissatisfied? Vy\u0101sa pondered very deeply, sitting in an isolated spot on the bank of the Sarasvati River. Then, he said within himself, I followed all my spiritual practices properly. I perfectly worshiped the Vedas and the gurus. I have divided one Veda into four and wrote the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, by which even naive people can get benefited. But still, why am I feeling so incomplete? By such honest self-examination, Vy\u0101sa could figure out the cause for his dissatisfaction. He thought, This may be because I did not adequately describe the enchanting activities of Lord Krsna and the process of bhakti in my books. Bhakti, or loving devotional service to Lord Krsna, is the natural activity of all living beings. The path of bhakti is most pleasing to the pure devotees and the Lord Himself. As Vyasa was thinking thus, his guru, N\u00e4rada Muni came to his hermitage. Vy\u0101sa stood up respectfully, welcomed his guru, and worshiped him. N\u00e4rada knew the situation of Vyasa and the cause of his dissatisfaction. So, he smiled and said, Dear Vy\u0101sa, in the books you have written, you have not sufficiently stressed on the glorious path of bhakti. And you have not adequately described the glories and pastimes of Lord Krsna. Please do it now; only then will your heart be satisfied. Even imperfectly written literature is appreciated by saints if they describe the wonderful and superhuman activities of God. Vy\u0101sadeva identified the reason for his dissatisfaction by introspection, and N\u00e4rada Muni reconfirmed it. To inspire Vy\u0101sa, N\u00e4rada narrated his past life, I was the son of a maidservant in my previous life. But by the holy association of great devotees called the bhakti-vedantas, I was inspired to perform bhakti. Thus, I became N\u00e4rada Muni and attained a spiritual body. The results of the sincere practice of bhakti are eternal. By bhakti, one can attain the supreme shelter of God and be relieved of all miseries. Bhakti transforms even sinful people into virtuous persons. So, please write \u015arimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing the path of bhakti vividly. N\u0101rada brought great clarity in Vyasa's thoughts and gave him specific direction for his further writing work. Having thus advised Vy\u0101sa, N\u00e4rada Muni departed. N\u00e4rada Muni personally experienced the power of bhakti. Thus, he had inspired Vyasa to write the glories of bhakti and historical narrations of those transformed by bhakti. After that, Vy\u0101sadeva sat to meditate in a devotional mood. In his vision, he saw Lord Krsna and m\u0101y\u0101, His illusory energy. He also saw people suffering due to the influence of may\u0101. He knew that the solution to this suffering was bhakti or loving service to Lord Krsna. Thus, to vividly explain the path of bhakti, he compiled \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavatam, in which he described the activities of Lord Krsna, His incarnations, and His dear devotees. His heart was then fully satisfied. Later Vy\u0101sadeva taught the Bhagavatam to his son Sukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b.",
        "quotes": "It's a very satisfying experience for the heart to hear, read, write or speak the pastimes of Lord Krishna and His devotees., However great one may be, one could get bewildered at times. Therefore, one needs the guidance of mature persons to overcome confusion and attain clarity., One who is benefitted from bhakti desires to share it with others as well., An intelligent person takes advantage of the timeless wisdom of the sacred Bhagvatam for a enlivering social and spiritual life.",
        "trivia": "Parampara Of Srimad Bhagavatam: Lord Krsna originally spoke Srimad Bhagavatam to Lord Brahma at the beginning of the creation. Brahma later spoke the Bhagavatam to Narada Muni, who later taught it to Vyasadeva. Vyasa taught the Bhagavatam to his son Sukadeva Gosvami who later narrated it to King Pariksit, Suta Gosvami and others. Suta Gosvami spoke the Bhagavatam to the sages of Naimisaranya, headed by sage Saunaka. Thus the Bhagavatam descended in a chain of authentic teachers and students called parampara. In this bona fide parampara, all the teachers are the representatives of Lord Krsna, because they transparently transmit the transcendental teachings of Krsna, without any deviation or imagination, for our transformation. Therefore, by sincerly hearing Srimad Bhagavatam from an authentic teacher, we can develop a love for Krsna, and be freed from all sorrows, confusions, and fears.",

But when we are open to learn from experienced teachers, our knowledge increases, and we overcome confusions.",

He was a playboy, expert in decorating himself with flower garlands, sandalwood pulp, cosmetics, and ornaments. He was most pleasing to the women of his city. Once the residents of heaven organized a spiritual gathering to glorify the Supreme Lord Krsna. Several devat\u0101s, including the Gandharvas and Apsaras, were invited for this spiritual event. Upabarhana also. went there surrounded by many women. Unfortunately, instead of glorifying God, he became intoxicated and sang some mundane songs inappropriate for the occasion. The members of the festival became upset with inappropriate conduct. The prajapatis who oversee the affairs of the universe, cursed him, You need to be punished for your misbehavior. May you become a low-class person, devoid of beauty. Being thus cursed, Upabarhana fell to the earth planet from the elevated heaven.

        "story": "As a result of the curse, Upabarhana took birth as the only son of a maidservant. She was simple, poor, and uneducated. Yet, she was fortunate enough to get an opportunity to serve noble-hearted brahmanas. She did menial services for the maintenance of herself and her child. She had no other relative apart from her only son. She bound him with the tie of great affection. She wanted to look after the boy's maintenance properly, but because she was so poor and dependent, she couldn't do much for the child. The boy was also dependent on his mother's affection and had no experience of different lands or people. He always believed that she would never leave him. When the boy was just five years old, he and his mother lived in a brahma\u0146a school. Once, some great sages called the bhakti-vedantas came there. They were sinless, learned in the Vedas, endowed with all good qualities and were pure devotees of Lord Krsna. They all decided to stay at that place during the four months of the rainy season. At this time, both the maidservant and her son rendered their various services. When the bhakti-vedantas were discussing the pastimes of Lord Krsna, the boy would attentively hear them. Thus, his taste for hearing about God increased gradually. Just as some diseases are contagious, bhakti is also contagious in a good sense. In the association of bhakti-vedantas, the boy became 'infected' with their purity and developed all good qualities and especially bhakti unto Krsna. The boy was disciplined, humble, and obedient to elders. He had no attachment to frivolous sports. He was not naughty or talkative. The sages were impressed with his conduct and blessed him. Although the boy was very young, the son of a maidservant, uneducated, he still became a great devotee of Lord Krsna, Slowly, be became greatly attracted to the path of bhakti, which constitutes bearing about Lord Krsna, chanting His names, and remembering Him. The boy fixed his mind on Lord Krsna steadily and engaged his body in serving the Lord in various ways. For example, he bowed down in front of the Lord and His devotees, carried a water pot with his hands, heard about the Lord with his ears, and so on. Thus, his ignorance was fully destroyed, and he became enlightened in Krsna consciousness. Thus, during the monsoon, in the association of sages, the boy developed prema, or love for Krsna, the ultimate aspiration of all beings. When the sages were departing, they mercifully taught the boy Srimad Bhagavatam even though he didn't ask for it. They initiated him in the path of pure bhakti unto Lord Krsna. This is the reward for his humility and service.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 1",
        "story": "After the departure of the great sages, the boy continued to live with his mother. He was overwhelmed with the stroke of inspiration he had just received in their wonderful company. He continued to meditate on their noble teachings. One day an unexpected incident happened in the boy's life. His poor mother went out of the house to milk a cow in the evening time. While walking along the path, she touched a snake with her foot, and the snake bit her leg. She died on the spot, and thus the boy lost his affectionate mother, his only caretaker. The boy was mature enough to see the hand of God even in this tragic incident. He thought, The Lord is the supreme well-wisher of His devotees. It is His mercy alone by which I am put in this situation. So, he decided to travel towards the north. Because the boy's mother served the bhakti-vedantas, the Lord must have given her a good destination, and her son is now kept fully under the shelter of the Lord. The boy passed alone through many cities, towns, villages, farms, A mines, agricultural lands, valleys, gardens, forests, hills, and mountains. He got an impetus in spiritual life and did not waste time for a single moment. He continually meditated on Lord Krsna during His travels. He came upon reservoirs of water filled with beautiful lotus flowers, surrounded by bees and singing birds. He traveled through huge fearsome forests dense with reeds, cane, clumps of grass, and hollow bamboos, the playground for snakes, owls, and jackals. Still, he was not fearful, as he constantly depended on the Lord. Thus traveling, he felt tired, both bodily and mentally. He was both thirsty and hungry. He saw a river, took a bath in it, and drank some water. He was thus relieved from exhaustion. He sat under the shade of a big banyan tree. He then began to meditate upon Lord Krsna with great love. He fully concentrated his mind on Param\u0101tm\u0101 or the Supersoul situated within the heart, as taught to him by the sages. While the boy meditated on the Lord with great emotion and love, tears fell from his eyes, and Lord Sri Krsna appeared in his heart. The boy could experience the fragrance of Krsna's body, the sound of Krsna's ankle bells and the beauty of Krsna's face. He was thus absorbed in an ocean of ecstasy and was covered with goosebumps erupting so much out of intense love. While in such bliss, he suddenly lost the vision of the Lord. He couldn't see the attractive form of Krsna anymore in his meditation. He was agitated from the sorrow of separation. He became despondent, like someone who has lost a treasure. He desired to see the Lord repeatedly and tried to meditate with great eagerness but couldn't see the Lord. He was thus dissatisfied and very much aggrieved. The sun rises on his own, and the Lord also reveals Himself to us when He wants. Pleased by seeing the boy's attempts in that lonely place, Krsna mercifully spoke to him to encourage him. The Lord said, In this body, you cannot see Me anymore. I am invisible to those who are incomplete in service and who still have impurities. I showed Myself to you once, just to increase your desire to see Me more. By serving My devotees and Me even for a few days, one attains firm devotion for Me. You will soon become My associate in the spiritual world after giving up the present body. Then the Lord stopped speaking. Since then, the boy repeatedly chanted the Lord's holy name. He traveled in this world, being humble, satisfied, and non-envious. In due course of time, he was absorbed in Krsna and became detached from all material taints and met with death. Quitting the material body, he received a spiritual body, befitting an associate of the Lord. In his next life, he became the great sage N\u00e4rada, a pure devotee of Lord Krsna. In the next creation, when Lord Brahma was creating the universe. this boy appeared as the son of Brahm\u0101, in a spiritual body. He was called N\u00e4rada Muni, the best among the sages. The Lord gifted him a musical instrument called vind. While playing that vind, Narada travels unrestrictedly both in the spiritual and material worlds, singing about the Lord and spreading the path of bhakti. As soon as He chants, the Lord at once appears in the heart, as if called for. N\u00e4rada Muni is a great teacher of bhakti and is the guru of several devotee kings like Dhruva, Prahlada, Priyavrata, and others.",
        "quotes": "Although devotees sometimes face difficulties in life, they don't give up their faith in the protection of the Lord., One who has complete faith in the Lord's mercy does not fear any material difficulty., One must meditate on God as taught by scriptures and gurus, not according to one's imagination., we cannot demand the Lord to be present before us, just as we cannot demand the sun to rise whenever we like.",

While Arjuna killed several warriors, Bhima killed the ninety-nine brothers of Duryodhana and defeated him in a club fight. A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 desired to please the defeated Duryodhana.

Seeing his life in danger, his horses exhausted, and finding no alternative, A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 released a brahmastra, the ultimate weapon. He couldn't understand that the brahmastra could destroy the world. He didn't even know how to withdraw it. Yet, he thoughtlessly released it just to save himself. Thereupon, a glaring light spread in all directions indicating a great danger. Bewildered at this, Arjuna took shelter of Krsna and said, My dear Lord. You make Your devotees fearless. I don't understand the reason and source of this dangerous effulgence spreading everywhere. Lord Krsna then explained, Dear Arjuna, A\u015bvatth\u00e4m\u00e4 released a brahmastra out of fear for his life. He doesn't know howto retract it. Only another brahmastra can counteract it. Please release your brahmastra and retract both the brahmastras. Hearing this, Arjuna circumambulated Krsna and cast his brahmastra. By the blessings of Krsna, Arjuna at once retracted both brahmastras, Arjuna, his eyes blazing in anger, then bound A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 with ropes, took him to the military camp and entrusted him to Draupadi. Draupadi was a kind-hearted lady and an exalted devotee of Lord Krsna. She was not comfortable seeing A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 bound by ropes. With deep compassion and respect, she spoke to Arjuna and the Pandavas, Please release him. After all, he is a brahma\u0146a. His father Dron\u0101c\u0101rya had mercifully taught you Pandavas all military arts. Although Drona had died, now he is being represented by his son, A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. We k\u1e63atriyas are supposed to be respectful to the brahma\u0146as, who are naturally our gurus. Draupadi demonstrated her respectful attitude for the br\u0101hmanas, and exhibited her empathy for another woman. She said, Drona's wife Krpi is still living. I know the pain of a mother who had lost her son. I am experiencing the agony of the death of my sons. I don't want to give similar pain to Krpi. Please don't make her cry like me. Draupadi's words were filled with mercy, empathy, forgiveness, honesty, and justice. Yudhisthira Mah\u00e4r\u00e4ja supported her arguments. Nakula, Sahadeva, S\u0101tyaki, Arjuna, Krsna, the ladies and others all unanimously agreed with her. But Bhima disagreed with them, and strongly recommended killing of A\u015bvatth\u00e4m\u00e4. Yet Draupadi wanted to save him. To prevent both of them, Lord Krsna manifested two extra arms. With two hands, Krsna was trying to stop Bhima, and with two hands, He tried to stop Draupadi. With a smile, Krsna spoke to Arjuna, A brahmana shouldn't be killed. But if he does a criminal act, he can be killed. O Arjuna, please fulfill your promise to Draupadi and satisfy Bhima and Me. Arjuna heard these contradictory orders of Krsna and responded intelligently. Arjuna took his sword and cut both hair and jewel from the head of A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. This lifelong punishment of insult was symbolic of his death. He had already lost his bodily luster due to infanticide (killing children). Now he lost his strength due to the loss of his jewel. A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 was then unbound and driven out of the camp. After that, the Pandavas and Draupadi overwhelmed with grief, performed the necessary rituals for their departed relatives.",
        "quotes": "Evil people do not hesitate to perform any ruthless activity to satisfy their egos and revengeful attitudes., Selfish men think only of their safety and do not acknowledge how their activities trouble others. But noble people take responsibility for the welfare of others., A kindhearted devotee, although personally experiencing pain, doesn't want others to suffer like oneself. This is empathy.",
        "activity": "1. Recall an incident in which someone troubled you with their words or actions, and it was difficult for you to forgive them. Share your thoughts on that incident after reading the story of Draupadi. 2. Does forgiveness imply that one shouldn't take any action to correct a wrongdoer? Explain.",
        "lesson": "A Lesson On Empathy: One may not be able to acknowlege other's pain when one is personally experiencing pain. But empathetic people can do so. Empathy is to put oneself in the situation of others and see what they undergo. In this story, although Asvatthama's act deeply pained Draupadi, she could empathize with his mother and excuse him from punishment. Learning from the example of Draupadi, we should also try to empathize with others as much as possible., A Lesson On Forgiveness: Great people can tolerate personal suffering but cannot see other's suffering. They do not wish to harm even those who have harmed them. Taking inspiration from them, let us try to forgive others, at least for their small and unintentional mistakes, to begin with. Of course, if it's necessary and unavoidable sometimes the wrongdoers must be punished. The Pandavas did so in the Kuruksetra war, under the guidance of Krsna, to establish dharma. But while punishing offenders, devotees do not hold any grudge, hatred, or envy.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 1",
        "story": "Lord Krsna assisted the Pandavas in various ways in the Kuruksetra war. The love of the Pandavas for Krsna is unparalleled. Even after the war, Krsna continued to stay at Hastin\u00e4pura to pacify and encourage the Pandavas, who had lost their relatives in the war. Finally, after some time, Krsna took permission from His relatives and prepared to go to His city, Dv\u0101rak\u0101. He exchanged greetings with the P\u00e4ndavas and the brahma\u0146as there and sat on His chariot to depart. Suddenly, Uttar\u0103 came running towards Krsna, seeking His protection. Uttara was the wife of Abhimanyu, who died in the battle of Kuruksetra. She was pregnant at that time, with the last heir of the Pandavas' dynasty (Par\u012bksit) growing in her womb. Uttara realized that some fiery arrow was coming towards her. Although her powerful fathers-in-law, Arjuna, Bhima, and Yudhisthira were present there, without a second thought, Uttara ran towards Krsna for she was naturally dependent on Krsna in all circumstances. Uttara prayed to Krsna, O Lord, no one else can protect me except You. A fiery arrow is coming towards me fast. Let it burn me personally, but not kill my unborn child. Being a noble mother, Uttar\u00e4 loved her child more than her own life. Krsna understood that shameless A\u015bvatth\u00e4m\u00e4 had again released a brahm\u0101stra to kill Uttar\u00e4's embryo. He was determined to wipe out even the last descendant of the Pandavas. Krsna instantly entered Uttara's womb, in a thumb-sized form with four hands. He wore a shining crown, earrings of molten gold, a yellow cloth as good as lightning, and eyes blood red with anger. The child in Uttara's womb was astonished to see the glowing Lord. Krsna vanquished the heat of bralumastra just as the sun evaporated a drop of dew. Then He disappeared from there as the child wondered. While Krsna was present inside the womb of Uttar\u0103 in a small form, He was also present in front of Uttara in His chariot. Overwhelmed with gratitude and devotion, the chaste queen Kunti, mother of the Pandavas, praised Krsna: O Lord, You are the Supreme person. I am fortunate to see Your beautiful form. You have protected my sons from various dangers. Proud people cannot understand You, but humble devotees can easily see You. Your birth and activities are inconceivable. The prosperity of this kingdom is only due to Your grace. So, let my mind constantly flow towards You exclusively, as the Ganges flows towards the ocean. After some time, Uttara gave birth to her noble son Pariksit. The boy was born when all signs of the zodiac were favorable. His grandfather Yudhisthira had brahma\u0146as such as Dhaumya and Kripa recite mantras and perform his birth rites. Moreover, Yudhisthira gave charity to the brahmanas profusely. The brahmanas predicted the future qualities and activities of Pariksit: This child will be known as Vi\u015fnu-rata because Visnu has protected him. He will have all good qualities. He will be as good as Lord Rama in being true to his promise. He will be like Arjuna amongst the bowmen. He will increase the reputation of his family. He will be as strong as a lion and as merciful as Lord Siva. He will become a great devotee of Krsna like Prahlada. King Yudhisthira felt very happy hearing these predictions. Par\u012bksit was fortunate enough to have the darsana of Krsna right within the womb of his mother. He wondered who the Lord was. After his birth, he constantly searched for the Lord whom he saw before his birth. He examined everyone he saw to find if he were the Lord. Therefore, his name was Pariksit, one who examines. The royal prince Parik\u015fit luxuriantly grew up under the care of his grandfathers, like the moon during the waxing fortnight. After Lord Krsna disappeared from this planet, the Pandavas enthroned Par\u012bksit as the emperor and retired. King Parik\u015fit ruled the kingdom under the guidance of br\u0101hmanas. He married a princess named Iravati. He had four sons, of whom the eldest was Janamejaya.",
        "quotes": "A devotee's dependence on Krishna is as natural and as spontaneous as a child's dependence on the parents., Envious people always try to trouble devotees. But the devotees take shelter of Lord Krishna in all difficulties., Krishna is omnipresent, i.e., He can be there at multiple places at the same time., Lord Krishna is very affectionate to His devotees.

        "lesson": "A Lesson On Dependence: Uttara's spontaneous dependence on Lord Krsna is just like a child's natural dependence on the mother. Lord Krsna is always attentive to the needs of such dependent devotees. When we proudly think that we can save ourselves solely by our strength, we cannot feelingly take shelter from the Lord. The Lord reciprocates with His devotees to the degree of their dependence. The stories of great devotees inspire is to seek the shelter of Krsna, apart from being what is possible from our side.",

        "title": "The King Who Saved A Cow",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 1",
        "story": "Once, Emperor Parik\u015fit heard unpleasant news that Kali had entered his kingdom. Kali was the personality representing the current age called Kali-yuga. There are four ages or yugas, namely Satya-yuga, Treta-yuga, Dvapara-yuga, and Kali-yuga. As yugas appear in this order, the life span and good qualities of people will reduce. Parik\u015fit took up his bow and arrows and prepared himself to conquer Kali. As a courageous ksatriya king, he was not at all afraid of fighting. As he traveled on his well-decorated golden chariot, accompanied by his troops, the rulers of different places offered him tributes. At many places, Parik\u015fit heard the glories of his ancestors, the Pandavas and their intimate relationship with Lord Krsna. Thus traveling, King Parik\u015fit reached Kuruksetra, on the banks of River Sarasvati. At that place, a cow and a bull were conversing. The cow was none other than Dhara, earth personified. And the bull was Dharma, morality personified. The bull had lost his three legs and was trying to stand only on one leg. The cow had lost her bodily luster and had tears in her eyes. The bull asked the cow, Why are you aggrieved? Are you sick? Or are you sad seeing my state, having lost three legs? Are you lamenting for yourself, being exploited by the meat-eaters? Are you unhappy that evil persons mistreat children and women? Are you worried that unqualified teachers are mishandling education? Are you sad seeing the exploitation of people by greedy kings? Or are you morose because Lord Krsna has disappeared from this planet? Are you missing Him? The cow replied, O Dharma, Lord Krsna has concluded His pastimes here and has gone back to His eternal abode. In His absence, Kali-yuga has spread its influence. I am very sorry to see this. I lament about -myself, you, the devotees, and all the followers of Dharma. When Lord Krsna was performing pastimes on my surface, Krsna had relieved me of the burden of the atheistic kings. I was beautifully decorated with His divine footprints, and my hairs (grasses) stood on end. I was the most fortunate planet in the universe at that time and was prosperous in all ways. Because He incarnates on this planet to establish Dharma, you were also greatly fortunate in His presence. But now that He went back to the spiritual world, I am suffering, and you are also suffering. As the cow and the bull were thus conversing, king Par\u012bksit reached there. He saw the cow and the bull and Kali next to them. Although unqualified, Kali was dressed like a king and was beating the cow and the bull. The poor cow was crying, distressed, and hungry. The bull was terrified. He was standing on one leg because Kali had destroyed three of his legs. The pitiful condition of the cow and the bull indicates that in Kali-yuga, the earth would be miserable, and the sinful people of this age would heavily compromise Dharma. Seeing the condition of the cow and the bull, Parik\u015fit questioned Kali in a deep voice, Who are you? You appear strong, and yet you beat helpless animals under my protection! You dress like a king but are acting like a low-class man. A culprit like you deserve to be killed. Pariksit then reassured the cow and the bull, Do not fear this man. Please do not cry. As long as I am living, you will have good fortune. O bull as white as the white lotus, you are certainly Dharma. In Satya-yuga, your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity (tapa), cleanliness (sauca), mercy (daya), and truth (satyam). Now three legs are broken due to pride, bad desires, and intoxication. You are now standing only on one leg (truthfulness), but this Kali is also trying to destroy that leg too. Previously, the Lord relieved the burden of the earth (cow). But nov she laments her future, ruled by lower-class men, posing as kings So shall kill this sinful rascal. King Pariksit then took up his sword to kill Kali at once. Seeing his imminent death and having no ability to fight, Kali gave up his kingly dress out of fear and fell at the feet of Pariksit. Par\u012bksit did not kill Kali but spoke to him, Because you are seeking my shelter, you need not fear for your life. But you can't remain in my kingdom. Because of you, adharma or immorality will prevail. And people will become victims of greed, falsehood, robbery, misfortune, cheating, quarrel, and vanity. So, get out of my kingdom immediately. Trembling in fear, Kali petitioned, O king, where can I go? Everywhere is your kingdom. So, please fix some permanent place for me under your shelter. Par\u012bk\u015fit then said, You can reside in places where there is gambling, intoxication, animal slaughter, and illicit relationships. Kali replied, O Par\u012bksit, such places do not exist in your pious kingdom. Please give me another place. Thoughtful Pariksit then said, You may live where there is gold. Because gold or wealth gives rise to falsity, intoxication, evil desires, envy, and enmity, Kali was thus allowed to reside in these five places. As a considerate person, Par\u012bk\u015fit chose places suitable to Kali's nature But at the same time, as a responsible king, he ensured that Kali could not perform his immoral activities. He engaged all the wealth in his kingdom in devotional activities and re-established the lost three legs of Dharma (austerity, cleanliness, mercy). Thus, he improved the earth's situation and didn't give any chance for Kali-yuga to progress. There is another important reason why Pariksit didn't kill Kali. He sawsomething good in Kali: In Kali-yuga, auspicious acts bear good results simply by intending to do them, whereas sinful acts bear bad results only by engaging in them. Also, Kali is fearful for the less intelligent but not for the self-controlled devotees. Considering this, Pariksit took special care of the foolish people.",
        "quotes": "The cow is like our mother as she gives us milk. The bull is like our father because he helps in agriculture by which we get grains to eat. Therefore, to beat or kill cows and bulls is a great offense., A king's main duty is to protect the innocent and punish the miscreants., Those who desire their well-being should avoid gambling, drinking, animal killing, and bad association.",

What would you like to do to uphold those legs in your life?",
        "lesson": "A Lessson On Responsibility: An ideal king takes responsibility for everyone in his kingdom without partially or discrimination. He protects his citizens in all possible ways. He cares for not only their physical survival but also their spiritual inspiration. Therefore, such a king is considered a bona fide representative of God in the Vedic times. His protection is not restricted to human beings but is extended to innocent animals too. Especially cow and bull are like the mother and father to human beings, and a virtuous king should not tolerate any offense caused to them. We should also learn to respect cows and bulls and serve them as much as we can.",

        "title": "A Severe Punishment For A Small Mistake",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 1",
        "story": "Once King Pariksit went on a hunting excursion. Wandering in the forest for a long time, he became tired and thirsty. In search of water, he came upon the hermitage of a sage called Samika. The sage was covered with deerskin and matted locks of hair. He was in deep meditation. Pariksit asked the sage for some drinking water. But the sage didn't respond because he was not in external consciousness. Pariksit felt unwelcomed and neglected. He became momentarily angry due to hunger and thirst. He found a dead snake near the hermitage, picked it up with his bow, and placed it on the sage's shoulder. He did this as a sign of return for a cold welcome. He then left for his palace. Pariksit didn't purposely insult the sage. His anger was circumstantial, and he cdidn't have any bad habits or qualities. He never disrespected brahma\u0146as before. \u0160amika R\u015fi had a five-year-old son named \u015arngi. While playing with other boys, he heard about the king's offense to his father at their hermitage. \u015arngi had brahmanical power both by birth and by training But he was inexperienced and immature. He didn't have proper culture and tolerance. Further, he was very puffed up with his brahmanical power due to the influence of Kali. \u015arngi proudly said, Oh! Just look at the sins of these arrogant kings They are like crows and watchdogs at the door. And brahmanas are their masters. How can they expect to enter the house and dine with the master on the same plate? So now that Krsna had disappeared, I shall punish them myself. Just see my great power! Then, with eyes red-hot with anger, Srngi cursed Pariksit, On the seventh day from today, a snake-bird will bite that wretched king who insulted my father Pariksit made a mistake, but it was small Yet short-sighted Srngi thoughtlessly gave him severe punishment. Srngi returned home and saw the dead snake around his father's neck and cried loudly. Hearing his son crying, Samika R\u015fi opened his eyes and saw the dead snake, and threw it off. He didn't pay much attention to it. Finally, he asked \u015arngi, Why are you crying? Did someone harm you? \u015arngi then explained what had happened. Hearing that \u015arngi had cursed king Parik\u0219it, Samika was upset with his son, Oh! You have committed a great sin. For an insignificant offense, you have given a great punishment. You are so immature. The king is the best among men. Citizens live in prosperity, being protected by such a noble king. A king is a representative of God, and he rules the kingdom on behalf of God. When such a king is abolished, the world becomes filled with thieves, and people will be unprotected, and will be injured and killed. We shall be responsible for all these sins. Emperor Pariksit is a pious and saintly king (r\u0103jarsi) and has performed many sacrifices for the welfare of humanity. He does not deserve to be cursed when fatigued by hunger and thirst. You have misused your power. \u015aamika then prayed for his son, May the Lord pardon this boy, whe had foolishly sinned cursing a sinless devotee. Samika thus regretted his son's foolish and impudent behavior. He didn't take the king's offense seriously.",

What will you do in the future if someone makes a mistake that makes you upset?",
        "lesson": "A Lesson On Tolerance: One's greatness is estimated by one's ability to tolerate provoking situations. Scriptural characters teach us what not to do in life. One should not be arrogant and impulsive like Sringi. But one must try to be patient and tolerant like Samika. Sometimes people may cause us some inconvenience unintentionally, under the heat of circumstances. One shouldn't take such occasional disturbances seriously but try to be tolerant. One should wisely use one's power and not misuse it like Srngi to unnessarily harm others.",

        "story": "King Pariksit returned to his palace from the forest. In the forest, he had placed a dead snake around the neck of sage Samika for not receiving him properly at his hermitage. Parik\u015fit reflected upon his act: I have performed a heinous offense against a faultless brahma\u0146a. While he was in meditation, I kept a dead snake around his neck and insulted him. Therefore, I must be punished for my misconduct not to commit such an offense again. And I don't want my friends and relatives to suffer for my mistake. Pariksit never intended to disrespect the sage, but he felt ashamed for his unusual behavior. As Par\u012bk\u015fit was thus repenting, a student of sage Samika named Gauramukha arrived at the palace. He informed Pariksit with deep embarrassment, Dear King, you have been cursed by sage Samika's son, Srngi, to die in seven days. Please make necessary arrangements before you die Hearing this, King Pariksit didn't become disappointed, hateful, or revengeful. Although his offense was minor and the curse was very severe, he still didn't become angry with Srngi or his father. He was powerful enough to counter curse Srngi, but he didn't do so. Although Pariksit was ashamed of his offense, he didn't go to Samika R\u0219i to beg forgiveness. Because Samika sent the news of the curse very regretfully, Pariksit felt that if he apologizes, that will further embarrass the sage. And Pariksit never desired the negation of the curse. Par\u012bksit retired from all his duties as a king and entrusted the kingdom to his son Janamejaya. He went to the southern bank of the River Ganges and sat on a straw mat there. The devat\u0101s, praising his actions, showered the earth with flowers and beat celestial drums. Finally, he decided to fast until death and take shelter of Lord Krsna. Lord Krsna personally protected Par\u012bk\u015fit when he was in the womb of his mother, Uttar\u0103. So then why didn't He save Parik\u015fit from death now? Because- (i) Krsna wanted to take Par\u012bksit to the spiritual world, the place of eternal happiness, and (ii) by putting Parik\u015fit in such a situation, Krsna wanted to give Srimad Bhagavatam to all of us. Hearing the news about Par\u012bk\u015fit, many great sages arrived on the bank of the Ganges from different parts of the universe. They included Atri, Cyavana, Saradv\u0101n, Aristanemi, Bhrgu, Vasistha, Par\u0101\u015bara, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, Vy\u0101sadeva, Narada and many others. Parik\u015fit welcomed all of them. Par\u012bk\u015fit respectfully received the sages and bowed his head. Although one br\u0101hma\u1e47a cursed Par\u012bk\u015fit, he didn't hate all the brahmanas. After the sages sat comfortably, Par\u012bksit humbly stood before them with folded hands and said, I am very fortunate to see you all. It is God who has appeared in the form of brahmana's curse. I have taken the Lord into my heart. Let the snake-bird bite me at once. I have no fear. I only desire that you all sing the glorious deeds of Lord Krsna. Even if I again take birth in this world, I just desire (1) attachment for Krsna, (ii) association of devotees, and (iii) friendly relations with all beings. The sages happily expressed their approval for Pariksi\u0165t's decision and said, It is not surprising that you have given up your royal throne to attain the Lord. We shall all wait here until you go to the spiritual world, the supreme planet of Krsna. Par\u012bk\u015fit was not fearful of the snakebite or death. He only desired to hear the glories of God in whatever time he had before his death. Pariksit asked the sages two questions, What is the duty of everyone in all circumstances? And what is the specific duty of a person about to die? At that moment, by the will of God, \u015arila Sukadeva Gosv\u0101mi, the glorious son of Vyasadeva, arrived there. He looked sixteen years old and with a bluish bodily hue like that of Lord Krsna. He looked charming. The sages honored him by rising from their seats. Par\u012bk\u015fit welcomed Sukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b with great respect and gratitude. Sukadeva sat on an elevated seat, surrounded by sages. He appeared like a moon amidst stars. He was intelligent and ready to answer any question. Parik\u0219it folded his hands and said, O great sage, by your presence, you have purified us. Simply by remembering pure devotees like yourself, our houses become sanctified. What to speak of seeing you, touching you, washing your holy feet, and offering you a seat? Just by your mere presence, even the greatest sins of a person are vanquished at once. Lord Krsna has accepted me as one of his relatives to show His affection to His cousins, the Pandavas. So, he made this arrangement that I get to meet you. Otherwise, how have you voluntarily appeared here to bless me? Generally, you hardly stay in the houses of men long enough to milk a cow. After thus praising Sukadeva, Parik\u015fit politely asked his two questione - How to live in this world? How to leave this world at the time of death? In response to these two questions, Sukadeva Goswami spoke Srimad Bhagavatam. Pariksit, whose death was only a week away, sat amidst great sages and eagerly heard the entire Bhagavatam. After one week, Sukadeva departed, and Par\u012bksit sat on a seat of darbha grass, meditating on Lord Krsna. Then the snake-bird Taksaka came there in the disguise of a br\u0101hmana. After reaching Parik\u015fit, Tak\u015faka bit him, and the body of Par\u012bksit immediately got burned to ashes, Everyone was astonished. The Gandharvas and Apsaras sang, and the demigods showered flowers and spoke words of praise. Thus, Pariksit went to the spiritual world. The brahma\u0146a's curse acted as a boon for Parik\u015fit who attained the Lord.",

Lord Krsna saved Pariksit from the attack of brahmastra when he was in the womb of his mother, Uttara. But Krsna didn't save him from the curse of Srngi. In both cases, Krsna was merciful to Pariksit, and Pariksit had faith in Krsna. Devotees know that nothing happens without the sanction of the Lord, who is their well-wisher. Instead of misunderstanding or blaming Him, they accept His decision and come closer to Him in difficulties. The Lord makes such devotees as instruments in His divine plans for causing welfare to humanity. Through the medium of Srngi's curse, Krsna took Pariksit to the spiritual world and gave us Srimad Bhagavatam.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 1",
        "story": "The Kuruksetra war has just ended. The virtuous Pandavas won the battle over evil Duryodhana and his supporters. They were guided and supported by their dear friend Lord Krsna in many ways. After the war, however, King Yudhisthira was overwhelmed with guilt and grief. He felt responsible for the death of thousands of men in the battle. Vy\u0101sadeva, Dhaumya, and other sages tried to pacify Yudhisthira by speaking philosophy. But no one could console him. He lamented, I am most sinful. My heart is full of ignorance. I have killed many thousands of men in the battle, including the brahmanas, friends, brothers, and gurus. I shall surely go to hell and will not be relieved from hell. But Yudhistira thought, I sinned killing so many people, only out of greed for a kingdom. I cannot counteract the pain I have given to so many women whose husbands and sons have been killed in the war. Even Lord Krsna tried to counsel Yudhisthira, by explaining that there was no sin on his part. But Yudhisthira was not pacified. Then Krsna inspired Yudhisthira to meet Bhismadeva, the grandsire of Kuru dynasty. Thus, the Pandavas, accompanied by Krsna, and sages like Vyasa and Dhaumya went to the battlefield of Kuruksetra where Bhisma was lying on a bed of arrows. In the war, Arjuna's arrows pierced every part of his body, and since then, he has been lying there. Bhismadeva, the illustrious grandfather of the Kuru dynasty, was a life long brahmacari (celibate) and a great devotee of Lord Krsna. He loved the Pandavas and protected them in various ways. Unfortunately, although being valiant and vastly learned, he had to fight on the wrong side against the virtuous Pandavas. It was because Lord Krsna wanted to teach the world the following important lesson through Bhisma. And Bh\u012b\u015fma played his humble part in the Lord's divine plan by fighting on the side of Duryodhana. Bhisma, however, always had affection for the Pandavas as they were righteous. Bh\u012b\u1e63ma always wanted to see the Pandavas happy and prosperous, but because of Duryodhana and his associates like \u015aakuni, Pandavas were put into several troubles. Now that the Pandavas have gained the kingdom and became prosperous, Krsna brought them before Bhisma so that he could be happy in his final moments. Also, Lord Krsna wanted Yudhisthira to be enlightened by Bh\u012b\u015fma. That is the reason for Yudhisthira's not getting pacified by anyone, including Krsna and Vy\u0101sa. Krsna thus wanted to show Bh\u012b\u1e63ma's great knowledge to the whole world. Further, Krsna wanted to make His pure devotee Bh\u012b\u015fma happy by giving him dar\u015bana at the time of his death. Bhisma saw the Pandavas very aristocratic and felt happy. The Pandavas and Krsna bowed down before Bhisma. At that time, great sages from all over the universe, like Parvata Muni, Narada Muni, Bharadv\u0101ja, Para\u015bur\u0101ma, Vasistha, Gautama, Atri, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Ka\u015byapa, and others had assembled there to see glorious Bhisma. Their disciples also came with them. Bhisma welcomed all of them properly as per his ability. Because arrows pierced his whole body, he couldn't even move. Still, he received all the guests assembled there with his sweet words and hearty expressions. Bh\u012b\u015fma especially worshiped Lord Krsna, knowing Him to be the Supreme God. Seeing the Pandavas overwhelmed and silent, Bh\u012b\u015fma had tears. He encouraged them, Oh, what great injustices you good people had to face! Still, you all were saved because of your devotion to the brahma\u0146as, dharma, and Krsna. Kunti also suffered greatly due to Pandu's death and faced many difficulties raising young sons. Even in the presence of Yudhisthira - the son of Dharma, Bh\u012bma - the great club fighter, Arjuna - the expert bowman, and Krsna as your direct well-wisher, there were many difficulties! I consider all this to be the Lord's divine plan. So, accept it and follow it. You should rule the kingdom and take care of your citizens, as the Supreme Lord Krsna had desired. After consoling the Pandavas, Bhisma spoke about Lord Krsna, This Krsna is moving as a member of Yadu dynasty, like one of us. But He is the Supreme God. Only pure devotees can understand His greatness. You all thought of Him to be your cousin, friend, messenger, and so on. But He is the Supersoul (Param\u0101tma) in everyone's heart. Although He is equal to all, He is especially inclined to His devotees. So, He has mercifully come before me now at the last stage of my life. May He await me with His pleasing smile while I am quitting this body. Yudhisthira then inquired from Bhisma about various dharmas. And Bhisma explained to him about the duties of different members of human society, the responsibilities of kings, and the responsibilities of devotees. At that time, the auspicious time of uttar\u0101yana had arrived. Bhisma then withdrew his mind from everything else and focused only on Lord Krsna, who stood before him, in a four-handed form, which was Bhisma's favorite. Bh\u012b\u015fma then offered his heartfelt prayers to the Lord, My master Krsna has mercifully come to me in my last moments. Let me offer Him the gift of my loving thoughts and emotions. Let me have a love for that friend of Arjuna (Vijaya-sakha). His glittering yellow clothes shine in the sun, and curly locks of hair surround his lotus face. Let my mind go unto \u015ar\u012b Krsna on the battlefield, whose flowing hair was covered with dust raised by the horses, and whose face was wetted with sweat. let when My sharp arrows wounded his skin, He enjoyed it. Bh\u012b\u015fma continued, May I have a love for P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi (the charioteer of Arjuna), who stood with a whip in His right hand, and the reins in His left, carefully protecting Arjuna and his chariot. At the R\u0101jas\u016bya-yaj\u00f1a conducted by Yudhisthira, I witnessed Him being worshipped by great kings and sages as the most exalted. Thus meditating on Krsna, Bh\u012b\u015fma left this world and entered a Vaikuntha planets, where Lord Krsna is in His form of P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi (Arjuna's chariot driver). Celebrating this event, the devat\u0101s praised Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and showered flowers from the sky. Then Yudhisthira performed funeral rites for Bh\u012b\u015fma and was overtaken with grief. Yudhisthira, along with Lord Krsna, went back to Has inapura and consoled Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u015fra and Gandh\u0101r\u012b. King Yudhisthira then ruled the kingdom in an exemplary way, according to the teachings of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Lord Krsna.",

        "story": "Once upon a time, the state police were chasing some thieves. Searching everywhere, they caught the thieves who had concealed themselves in the hermitage of a sage named Manduka Muni. The policemen arrested all the thieves and also Mand\u016bka Muni and presented them in front of the magistrate. The magistrate decided punishment for the thieves and even Mand\u016bka Muni. He ordered that Mand\u016bka Muni be killed by piercing him with a lance. This is called \u015b\u016bla-dandana \u2013 the punishment of piercing a man's rectum with a lance that passes up to his head, thus killing the person. When Mand\u016bka Muni was just about to be pierced with the lance, the news reached the king. The king at once came there and stopped the punishment, considering that Mand\u016bka was a sage. The king begged forgiveness from Mand\u016bka for the mistake of his men. Mand\u016bka Muni then immediately went to Yamar\u0101ja, the lord of death. Yamar\u0101ja is the appointed authority that prescribes the destiny of the living beings. He punishes all sinful people in hell. Mand\u016bka Muni questioned Yamar\u0101ja, Why was I mistreated in this way? What was the reason for arranging such a punishment to me? Yamar\u0101ja replied, My dear sage, in your childhood, you had pierced an ant with a sharp thorn. For that reason, you are now put into this difficulty. Mand\u016bka Muni said, How could you fix such a severe punishment for an act I did out of childish innocence? It is quite unwise on your part. I curse you for being born as a low-class person for your unreasonable judgment. The curse of the sage was powerful. Therefore, Yamar\u0101ja took birth as Vidura, the son of a maidservant on this earth. Although Yamar\u0101ja was a great devotee of the Lord, he was still cursed in this way. This apparent punishment was also a reward for him. Yamar\u0101ja is always busy in his official service of punishing sinful beings in hell. When he became Vidura through Mand\u00fcka Muni's curse, he got the opportunity to participate in the pastimes of Lord Krsna in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Vidura was one of the prominent personalities in the Mahabharata. He was born by the mercy of Vyasadeva, from the maidservant of Ambik\u0101, mother of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u00e4ndu. Thus, Vidura grew up as the younger brother of Pandu and Dhrtar\u00e4stra, who were also born by the power of Vyasadeva. Although low-born because of the curse, Vidura was a mine of good qualities and great wisdom. He was also an ardent devotee of Lord Krsna. Vidura was considered a part of the Kuru dynasty and was lovingly treated by Bhismadeva, the grandsire of the dynasty. Dhrtar\u00e4stra gave him sufficient property. Vidura was attached to Dhrtarastra. He acted as a reliable advisor to Dhrtar\u00e4stra and always tried to guide him on the right path. Vidura was fortunate to hear Srimad Bhagavatam from a sage named Maitreya Muni. Vidura himself became a great teacher of moral and spiritual knowledge. He had later inspired Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra to take up to the spiritual path. After spending about a hundred years on the earth as Vidura, Yamar\u0101ja went back to his abode and resumed his duties. As long as Yamraja on the earth as Vidura, a devta named Aryama occupied his post to punish those who committed sinful acts. Aryama was one of the sons of sage Kasyapa and his chaste wife, Aditi. Aditi and Kashyapa had twelve sons who were known as Adityas, and Aryama was one of them. Therefore, he was capable of taking charge of the office of Yamraja during his one hundred years of absence in the form of Vidura.",

        "story": "Dhrtarastra, the blind king of Hastinapura, had one hundred sons. The eldest of them was evil Duryodhana. Duryodhana had great greed for the throne of Hastin\u0101pura. In various ways, he tried to kill the noble Pandavas, the five sons of Dhrtar\u00e4stra's brother P\u00e4ndu. Dhrtar\u0103\u015ftra supported the unfair desires of his sons and never stopped them. Duryodhana had once set fire to the lacquer house where the Pandavas stayed to burn them alive. Duryodhana ordered his younger brother Duh\u015b\u0101sana to disrobe Draupadi, the chaste wife of the Pandavas publicly. Duryodhana had cheated the Pandavas in a gambling match, took away his kingdom, and sent them to the forest. Proud Duryodhana didn't even respect the good advice of Lord Krsna, who came with a peace message. He boldly refused to give the rightful share of the kingdom to the Pandavas. These are some atrocities done by Duryodhana and his wicked associates, supported by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u015ftra. One day, Dhrtar\u0103\u015ftra's brother Vidura met him. Vidura was acting as a loyal minister of Hastinapura and was advising the king in various ways. Now he spoke to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra, Please return the rightful share of the kingdom to the Pandavas. They have tolerated so many of your offenses. Otherwise, revengeful Bhima, who is breathing like a snake, will attack your sons. And Lord Krsna is personally on their side, and all the kings and the Yadus are with Krsna. Dhrtar\u00e4stra thought that his son Duryodhana would be able to oppose the Pandavas and Krsna. Guessing such an argument from him, Vidura said, Get rid of your wicked son Duryodhana for the benefit of the family. He is offense personified. He is envious of God and causes inauspiciousness. Duryodhana then arrived there and heard Vidura's advice to Dhrtar\u00e4stra. He became furious. Swollen with anger and his lips trembling, he insulted virtuous Vidura: Who called this son of a maidservant here? Although subsisting on our mercy, he is always siding with the enemy's interests. Get out from this palace immediately, with only your breath as the only possession. Duryodhana's sharp words struck Vidura. Although Vidura was elderly and a respectable uncle of Duryodhana, and a responsible minister of Hastinapura, still proud Duryodhana dared to disrespect him. Vidura's brother Dhritar\u00e4stra didn't stop Duryodhana from his arrogant misbehavior. He was a victim of his fatherly affection for his evil son Duryodhana. As a father and a king, he was supposed to guide Duryodhana on a good path and correct him when he made mistakes But Dhritarastra didn't do that. He just supported several of his son's misdeeds. He is an example of a bad father. Vidura then placed his bow at the door and left the palace of Hastinapura. He didn't feel sorry but saw the hand of God in this situation. The same incident had two different types of impact on Duryodhana and Vidura according to their moods. By insulting Vidura. Duryodhana was heading towards his ruination. He was at a loss by banishing a wise person who could guide him on the right path. But Vidura headed towards an enlivening spiritual journey. He went away from all the political issues at Hastin\u00e4pura to immerse himself in wonderful pilgrimage. That's how he converted this crisis as an opportunity to elevate himself spiritually. Vidura was pure and pious, yet he thought that he had become impure by the association of the diplomatic Dhrtar\u0103\u015ftra and Duryodhana. Therefore, he felt that he was not fit to associate with Lord Krsna at once. Thus, although Krsna was present in the world at that time, Vidura did not approach Him. Instead, he decided to travel to holy places and purify himself. Vidura traveled alone, thinking of Lord Krsna with pure devotion. He saw many holy places where many deities were situated. As he was on his pilgrimage, the Kuruksetra war had happened. In that war, Duryodhana was defeated by the Pandavas, and king Yudhisthira gained control over the earth. When Vidura reached a place known as Prabh\u0101sa-k\u015fetra, he came to know that many of his relatives had died in the battle. He silently proceeded on his pilgrimage.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 3",
        "story": "Being insulted by proud Duryodhana, noble Vidura left Hastinapus and went on a pilgrimage. He visited eleven holy places on the bank River Sarasvati. He also visited many temples established by grea devotees. He took dar\u015bana of several deities of Lord Visnu. Passing through various provinces, Vidura finally reached the bank of River Yamuna and met Uddhava there. Uddhava was a cousin and great devotee of Lord \u015ar\u012b Krsna. He was also a disciple of Brhaspati, the guru of the devat\u0101s. Uddhava was an intimate associate of Krsna and used to stay in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, the city of Lord Krsna. Vidura affectionately embraced Uddhava, and asked him, Are the Lords Krsna and Balarama doing well in Dv\u00e4raka? How are Krsna's parents Devaki and Vasudeva? How are Krsna's sons Pradyumna Samba, and others? How is Ugrasena, the grandfather and king? How are Krsna's associates Akr\u016bra, Aniruddha, Hrdika, Carudesna, Gada and others? How are the Pandavas and their mother, Kunti? I simply pity Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra who drove me out, although I am his sincere well wisher. But I am happy traveling now. When Vidura inquired about his beloved Lord Krsna and His devotees Uddhava became emotional. He couldn't reply immediately. He was a great devotee of Krsna since childhood. When he was a child, he was 50 absorbed in worshipping Krsna's deity that he did not wish to have breakfast even when his mother called him to eat. Although Uddhava has become old now, his love for Krsna did not slacken. On the contrary he was overwhelmed by the remembrance of Krsna hearing Vidura's questions and remained silent for some time. Vidura could understand that Uddhava went into a trance. Uddhava came back to external consciousness after a muh\u016brta (48 minutes) and then spoke to Vidura, Lord Krsna appeared in this world to cause welfare for all of us. But now He has ended His pastimes and disappeared from this planet. So what can I speak about our welfare? Vidura didn't know about Krsna's disappearance and was astonished to hear it. Uddhava reminded Vidura, You have directly witnessed the great auspiciousness of Lord Krsna. All the devat\u0101s assembled at the R\u0101jas\u016bya-yaj\u00f1a concluded that Krsna is the most beautiful personality. The gopis of V\u1ecbnd\u0101vana would always be absorbed in seeing and remembering Krsna's beauty. Although Krsna is unborn, He mercifully appears on this earth when Demoniac people harass his devotees. By killing demons, Krsna mercifully gives them liberation. He liberated even the envious \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la who always blasphemed Him. He gave the position of motherly nurse to the witch P\u016btana, who came to kill Him with her poisonous milk. Even the soldiers who died in the battlefield of Kuruksetra while seeing Krsna attained His abode. This was because they could see the beautiful form of Krsna while dying, and the arrows also purified them of Arjuna, a great devotee. How shall I take shelter of anyone more merciful than Krsna? No one is equal or superior to Krsna. He is worshipped and honored by the great kings and devat\u0101s, who touch their crowns to His feet. Having thus described the glories of Krsna, Uddhava then briefly narrated the pastimes of Krsna right form His birth. He said, Krsna was born to Vasudeva and Devaki at the request of Brahma, for the welfare of the earth. Out of fear of Kamsa, Vasudeva brought Krsna from Mathura to Vrnd\u0101vana. Krsna stayed at Vrnd\u0101vana with Balarama for about eleven years, under the care of Mother Yasoda and King Nanda. In Vrnd\u0101vana, Krsna performed pastimes with the cows and the gopas, in the beautiful forests and on the banks of River Yamuna. Kamsa had sent several demons like P\u00fctana, Trn\u0101varta, Bak\u00e4sura and so on to kill Krsna. But Krsna effortlessly killed them all just as a child breaks toys while playing. While herding the cows and bulls, Krsna played on His wonderful flute and enlivened everyone. Krsna drove away from the envious serpent Kaliya from Vrnd\u0101vana. He also inaugurated Govardhan-puja, lifted the Govardhan Hill, and protected His people from the devastating rainfall sent by Indra. Krsna also lovingly danced with the gopis (r\u0101sa-lila) in the moonlit autumn night. After describing Krsna's Vrindavan pastimes, Uddhava then narrated pastimes in Mathura and Dvaraka: One day, a minister of Kamsa named Akr\u00fcra came to Vrindavan, and took Krsna and Balarama to Mathura. At Mathura, Krsna killed Kansa and saved His parents Devaki and Vasudeva, and many others who were troubled by cruel Kamsa Krsna then went to the school of Sandipani Muni and learned all the Vedas and fine arts. He also brought the dead son of Sandipani Muni from Yamaloka Lord Krsna later kidnapped Rukmini-dev\u012b at her request and married her. He also married seven other women namely J\u00e4mbavati, Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, N\u0101gnajiti, Mitravind\u0101, K\u00e4lind\u012b, Saty\u0101 and Laksma\u0146a. He also killed the demon Narak\u0101sura and married the 16,100 princesses that Narak\u0101sura had kidnapped. The Lord expanded Himself into 16,108 and received service from His 16,108 queens. He begot in each of these queens ten sons exactly like Himself. To please His dear wife Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, Krsna brought the p\u0101rij\u0101ta tree from heaven. He also enabled His devotees to kill demoniac people like K\u0101layavana, Jar\u0101sandha, \u015aambara, Dvivida, and others. He had arranged the Battle of Kuruksetra and caused the death of many other miscreants in the war. He then established Yudhisthira as the emperor of the earth. After that, Krsna departed from this planet and went back to His eternal abode in the spiritual world. Before leaving, He gave Me profound spiritual teachings and told me to go to Badarik\u0101\u015brama and give His message to the sages there. Now I am on my way to Badarik\u00e4\u015brama. Vidura then requested Uddhava, My dear Uddhava, you are a pure devotee. Lord Krsna has personally taught you. I wish to accept you as my guru. Please give me the spiritual knowledge that Krsna had given you.Humble Uddhava was not ready to accept the elderly Vidura as his disciple. Vidura was of the age of his father to Uddhava. Therefore, Uddhava said, My dear Vidura, When Lord Krsna was giving me spiritual teachings, a great personality named Maitreya also heard them along with me. So you may please take lessons from the learned sage Maitreya. Uddhava spent the night, which passed like a moment, on the bank of the Yamuna and then departed in the morning. Finally, Vidura reached the bank of the Ganges and met sage Maitreya, a friend of Vy\u0101sadeva. Vidura then humbly requested Maitreya to speak about the pastimes of the Lord. And Maitreya very eagerly and respectfully taught Vidura several enlivening spiritual topics. Sage Maitreya spoke several spiritual subjects to noble Vidura. Maitreya first described how the universe was created. He then narrated the birth and activities of Lord Brahm\u00e4, the pastimes of Lord Varahadeva (Boar incarnation) and Lord Kapila, the characteristics of Vaikuntha and the family life of Devah\u00fcti and Kardama Muni. He also the narrated the stories of popular kings like Sv\u00e4yambhuva Manu, Daksa, Dhruva, Prthu, Anga, Vena, Pr\u00e4cinabarhi and the Pracetas. After receiving profound teachings from sage Maitreya, Vidura profusely thanked Maitreya and offered his humble respects. He then proceeded to Hastinapura.",
        "quotes": "Devotees are always eager to know about God from other devotees., A devotee can understand the greatness of another devotee., Even in separation from Krishna a devotee feels His presence through His remembrance., A humble person wants to learn even from a younger person., A humble person, although qualified, doesn't become eager to instruct a senior., A sincere student is always grateful to one's glorious teacher.",

Vidura was elder to Uddhava, but knowing Uddhava's superior knowledge and devotion, Vidura was eager to learn from Uddhava. However, Uddhava was not eager to teach his senior Vidura but humbly directed him to sage Maitreya. This is the culture of receiving and sharing knowledge., A LESSON ON ABSORPTION: When one deeply loves a person, one naturally remembers and speaks about them enthusiastically. The devotees naturally absorb themselves in discussions about Krsna's pastimes and qualities because they love Him more than their lives. Seeking inspiration from such wonderful devotees, we could also try to discuss about God when we meet our friends. Such absorption brings one closer to the heart of Krsna. Thus, individually and collectively, we become Krsna conscious.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 1",
        "story": "After Vidura heard several spiritual topics from Sage Maitreya, he decided to visit Hastin\u0101pura. His intention was not to stay comfortably at Hastinapura but to enlighten his brother Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u015ftra. Dhr\u1e5btar\u0101stra was not only physically blind but was also spiritually blind. He had led a life of attachment and selfishness so far. He was greedy for the kingdom and desired to have his evil son Duryodhana sit on the Hastin\u0101pura throne. In the Kuruksetra war, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra had lost all his sons. Yet he continued to stay in Hastin\u0101pura amidst royal comforts, being respectfully maintained by the virtuous king Yudhisthira. Vidura wanted to inspire Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra to take up to spiritual life. With this sole purpose in mind, he went to Hastinapura. At Hastin\u0101pura, King Yudhisthira, his mother Kunti, and all others became very happy to see Vidura after a long time. They all hurried to receive him. They greeted Vidura, embraced him, and cried out of affection. King Yudhisthira offered him a sumptuous meal. Vidura took some rest and then sat comfortably to exchange talks with the relatives. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhisthira then spoke to Vidura, My dear uncle, you always have been very kind and affectionate upon us. You protected us from many calamities like a bird protects her children with her wings. During your travels, how did you maintain yourself? What all holy places did you visit in your pilgrimage? Devotees like you are as good as holy places personified. You purify the holy places because you carry the Supreme Lord within your heart. Yudhisthira continued, You might have seen or heard of our relatives at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. They are always rapt in the service of Lord \u015ar\u012b Krsna. Are they living happily? Vidura answered all the questions of Yudhisthira, except one. He didn't speak about the disappearance of Lord Krsna and His Yadu dynasty because he knew that it would pain the hearts of Pandavas who loved Krsna more than their life. Vidura, respectfully treated, stayed at Hastinapura for some time. One day Vidura spoke to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra sarcastically addressing him O King! Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra wasn't the king at that time! Vidura spoke strongly, Get out of here immediately. Are you not ashamed of living here? You tried to kill the Pandavas by fire and poison, and even insulted their chaste wife, Draupadi. You have stolen their wealth. But now, you are being maintained by them! There is no need to live on the charity of those whom you offended in many ways. You are living like a household dog, taking food from Bh\u012bma. Don't you realize that death is approaching you soon? You have already become old. You were blind from birth, and now you are deaf, with shortened memory, and loose teeth. Your digestion is weak, and you are coughing up mucus. Still, you are so attached to the royal life and comforts! By the power of time, everyone is forced to give up everything, including wealth, honor, children, land, home, and even one's life. Your father, brother, well-wishers, and sons are all dead. Why are you still so attached to this degraded life? Please quit and take an interest in spiritual life. An intelligent person takes shelter of God. Being thus enlightened by Vidura, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra became inspired to take up spiritual life. He decided to retire from family life and give up the kingdom and royal comforts. He left home to set for the Himalayas to pursue the path of liberation. His chaste wife, Gandh\u0101r\u012b, followed him at her own risk. Vidura's purpose of visiting Hastin\u0101pura has now been fulfilled. So, he also departed from Hastin\u0101pura. As Yudhistira was anxious, Narada Muni arrived there. The Pandavas respectfully welcomed him, and Yudhistira asked him, I do not know where my two uncles and ascetic aunt have gone. Can you please guide us? Narada Muni then appeased Yudhisthira, My dear Yudhi\u015ftira, please do not lament. Just as a child sets up his toys and disperses them by his own sweet will, God brings people together and separates them by His supreme will. Yudhistira was concerned: How will Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra maintain himself? What about the danger of animals? N\u0101rada Muni said, You are now thinking of how your relatives will exist without you. But please understand that God is the supreme protector of everyone. The Lord provides for everyone's maintenance. Narada then revealed the future movements of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra, G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b and Vidura. He said, Your uncles and aunt have gone to the Himalayas, to Saptasrota, the place where the Ganges was divided into seven for the satisfaction of the seven great sages (sapta-ysis). There, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra is now engaged in yoga by controlling his mind and senses. He gave up all his thoughts about family and became absorbed in Lord Hari. Five days later, he will give up his body by the fire generated from his mystic power. He will thus attain liberation. G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b will also enter in that fire and will leave this world along with her husband. Vidura will go for pilgrimage. So please do not worry about them. Please focus on your responsibilities. Saying this, Narada Muni departed. Thus, by the able guidance of Vidura, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101stra was transformed and took an interest in spiritual life. And by the good counsel of N\u0101rada Muni, king Yudhistira gave up his lamentation and focused on his important duties.",

Formerly, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u015ftra didn't hear Vidura's advice, mainly due to his undue affection for his evil son Duryodhana. Even when Duryodhana insulted and banished Vidura, Dhrtarastra didn't stop him. Sti Vidura continued to act as a well-wisher Dhytarastra and enlightened him in spiritual lif Finally, Dhrtar\u00e4stra took benefit of the advice Vidura, his true friend.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 2,10",
        "story": "Did you ever wonder how this whole universe came into existence? The story behind the creation of the universe is very interesting. Lord Maha Visnu, lies on a gigantic ocean called the Karana Samudra or the causal ocean. Therefore, He is also called as K\u0101ranodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Visnu. When He exhaled from His bodily pores, millions of material universes emanated. He then expanded Himself and entered into each of those universes in the form of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Visnu. After entering a universe, Lord Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u015fnu found it empty and filled half of the universe with His perspiration. That perspiration formed a great ocean called the Garbhodaka ocean. Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Visnu lied down on the Garbhodaka ocean, on \u015ae\u015fa-n\u0101ga, His divine snake bed. A lotus sprouted from the navel of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u015fnu and illuminated everything within the universe. Within that gigantic lotus, Lord Brahm\u0101 took birth. He was the first created living being in the universe, and he had four heads. Not seeing anyone around and finding himself within the lotus, Brahma curiously tried to search for the root of the lotus. He entered its stem but couldn't trace out its root. Giving up his unsuccessful search, Brahm\u0101 came back to the top of the lotus. Inspired by Lord Visnu from within his heart, Brahm\u0101 meditated on the Lord for one hundred years. Brahma could then see the gigantic body of Sesa. Upon the Sesa bed, he saw the effulgent Lord Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Visnu lying alone. He looked splendorous with His shining body, ornaments, moonlike toenails, yellow cloth, a mark called \u015ar\u012bvatsa on His chest, and so on. He had an enchanting smile on His charming face. That smile vanquished all distress. Seeing Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u015fnu, Brahm\u0101 became very happy. Brahma's service was to populate the universe with various types of living beings (souls). The souls are eternal, and they are never created. They all are children of God. What Brahm\u0101 had to create were only the different species of life. The souls enter the bodies of different species according to their past activities. For example, someone accustomed to eating flesh enters the body of a carnivorous animal like a tiger or a lion in the next life. Because it was the beginning of the creation, Brahm\u0101, the first living entity, has to create all these species. By Lord Vi\u015fnu's grace, Brahm\u0101 could understand that his service was to populate the universe with different living species. Brahm\u0101 wanted the necessary strength and empowerment from Lord Visnu to carry out his service. Therefore, Brahm\u0101 began to offer heartfelt prayers unto Lord Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u015fnu. Brahm\u0101 prayed, O Lord, You reside within the hearts of Your devotees who love and serve You. You reciprocate with their service in their favorite forms. Please empower me with the necessary intelligence to create. Please protect me from the false pride of being the creator. May I not get deviated from the Vedic teachings. You are very merciful. Please bless Me by opening Your lotus eyes. Lord Visnu replied to Brahm\u0101, Do not be anxious. I shall favor you. By meditating on Me, you will know everything about creating various aspects in this universe. I will quickly fulfill all the desires of those who pray like you. You may now start creating various bodily forms of the living beings. Having said this, Lord Visnu had disappeared. As advised by Lord Visnu, Brahm\u0101 meditated for 100 years and thus acquired spiritual knowledge. He then entered into the whorl of the lotus. He divided the lotus into fourteen divisions. He thus created the fourteen worlds (planetary systems) suitable for the stay of different types of living beings. Thereafter, Lord Brahma created four children, popularly called the four Kum\u0101ras. He asked them to create progeny. But the Kum\u0101ras wanted to devote themselves to the Supreme Lord Vasudeva. They did not show interest in marriage, household life, and getting children. Instead, they wanted to remain as celibates (brahmac\u0101r\u012bs) forever. They even wanted to stay as five-year-old children forever. So, they refused Brahma's request. When Kum\u0101ras rejected Brahm\u0101's order, Brahm\u0101 became slightly angry, but he tried to control it. Yet his anger came out from between his eyebrows in the form of another child in blue and red complexion. The child cried anxiously. So, Lord Brahm\u0101 named the child 'Rudra' and designated eleven places for his stay and also offered him eleven wives called Rudr\u0101n\u012bs and asked him to create progeny. Lord Rudra then created progeny similar to himself in strength, form, and furious nature. They attempted to devour the universe instead of expanding it-this scared Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 then asked Rudra to stop such creation and perform austerity instead. Rudra agreed and went to the forest. Lord Brahma then created ten sons from different parts of his body. They include Vasistha, Daksa, Bhrgu, Kratu, Pulastya, Angir\u0101, Atri, Marici, Pulaha and Kardama. All of them were engaged in creating progeny and populating the universe. Brahma's another glorious son was N\u0101rada Muni, who remained a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. His main work is to inspire people in spiritual life and take to bhakti or loving devotion to God. After that, Brahma created the four Vedas, the four legs of dharma, various fine arts, sciences, and Vedic meters. In this way, by the mercy of Lord Visnu, Lord Brahm\u0101 created various sciences and prominent personalities in the universe.",

        "story": "Once, Lord Brahm\u0101 reflected that his ten powerful sons, including the sages, did not sufficiently increase the universe's population. While he was thinking like this, a man and a woman appeared from his body. They were Svayambhuva Manu and his queen \u015aatar\u016bp\u0101. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu respectfully addressed Lord Brahm\u0101, My dear father, you are the father of all living entities and the source of their sustenance. Please instruct me how I may serve you. As a son, I have to abide by your instructions. Therefore, I shall act to the best of my capacity to fulfill your orders. Seeing the obedience of Manu, Brahm\u0101 felt encouraged. He appreciated Manu as an ideal son as he said, All blessings unto you both. I am pleased with you because of your genuine submissiveness unto me with no reservation. A sane person adores and accepts the instructions of a superior with great delight and executes it to his full capacity. Praising Manu in this way, Brahm\u0101 gave him three instructions, (i) Beget children similar to you in quality, (ii) Rule the earth virtuously, and (iii) Worship Lord Visnu through sacrifices. By doing so, you will do the highest service unto me, and Lord Visnu will be pleased with you. Manu respectfully replied, My dear father, I shall abide by your order But I see that the earth, residence for all living beings, is now merged in the Garbhodaka Ocean. Please retrieve it. Brahm\u0101 was surprised and thought, While I am creating, the planet earth has been inundated. How to raise the earth? Let the Almighty Lord direct us. As Brahm\u0101 was thus thinking, a small form of Boar came out from his nostril in the size of a thumb. Within a moment, it grew gigantic in the sky like a great elephant. Brahm\u0101 and his sons wondered, seeing the Boar and thought, Is this gigantic Boar the Supreme Lord Himself? The Boar was Var\u0101hadeva, the Supreme Lord who appeared in this form to support Brahm\u0101 and Sv\u0101yabhuva Manu in their service. To enliven Brahm\u0101 and his sons, Lord Var\u0101ha roared tumultuously, which echoed in all directions. Hearing the all-auspicious sound of the all-merciful Lord, the denizens of the upper planets chanted mantras from the Vedas. Then, hearing their praise of His qualities through the Vedic hymns, Lord Var\u0101ha entered the Garbhodaka ocean playing like an elephant. The Lord's resounding roar is an open threat to all demons, but to His devotees, it is a reassuring boon. Lord Var\u0101ha then flew in the sky, with His tail slashing and His hard hairs quivering. His glance was luminous like the sun and the moon. He scattered the clouds with His hooves and white tusks. He imitated the actions of a Boar and searched after the earth by smell. He then entered the water and dived deep into the Garbhodaka ocean. Cleaving the water with His sharp hooves, Lord Var\u0101ha found the planet earth and lifted it on His white tusks. He appeared splendid with the earth on His tusks. Lord Var\u0101ha was so huge that all the oceans could submerge into His bodily pores. With the earth on His tusks, He appeared like an elephant holding a lotus flower with its trunk, a huge mountain decorated with clouds. The earth is considered Varaha's wife. Thus, Varaha and the earth appeared like father and mother together. The residents of the upper planets, namely Jana loka, Tapo loka, and Satya loka, were purified by the auspicious drops of water that sprinkled from the shaking of Lord Varaha's body. The Lord then placed the earth on the water and departed for His own abode. Brahma was thus relieved from His anxiety. Sv\u0101yabhuva Manu made the earth His residence and began his service of creating population in the world.",

Lord Brahm\u00e4's one day lasts for 1000 divya-yugas. One divya-yuga is a combination of the four yugas, namely Satya, Treta, Dv\u0101para, and Kali. Its duration is 4,320,000 years.

        "story": "Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana and Sanat-kum\u0101ra were the first four sons of Lord Brahm\u0101. Together they are called the four Kum\u0101ras. They travel throughout the material and spiritual skies. Although they were the first created personalities in the universe by Lord Brahm\u0101, they always look like five-year-old children and wander naked. Once the Kum\u0101ras desired to go to Vaikuntha, the eternal abode of Lord Visnu. In Vaikuntha, all the residents render service to Lord Visnu with great love and devotion. They all look similar to Lord Visnu. The forests in Vaikuntha are filled with beautiful desire trees that bear flowers and fruits of all seasons. The men and women in Vaikuntha fly in golden airplanes adorned with precious gems like emeralds. They constantly praise Lord Hari without any distractions. In Vaikuntha, all women are as beautiful as Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the eternal consort of Lord Visnu. These ladies are sometimes seen sweeping the already clean marble walls in Vaikuntha to receive the Lord's grace. They worship the Lord in their own gardens with Tulasi leaves. In Vaikuntha, there are beautiful birds like the cuckoo, parrot, swan, peacock and others. Although they have sweet singing voices, they all stop their own singing to encourage the bee that makes a humming sound praising Lord Hari. Even the Vaikuntha plants are non-envious. Although amazingly fragrant, flowers like lotus, lily, rose, etc., greatly respect Tulas\u012b and encourage her to serve Lord Visnu. They all know that Lord Hari likes Tulasi. The four Kum\u0101ras reached Vaikuntha and attained great joy. They crossed six gates and reached the seventh gate, where they saw two doorkeepers named Jaya and Vijaya. They both looked similar in their age and form and were well decorated like Lord Visnu. But they appeared somewhat agitated seeing the four Kum\u0101ras. The Kum\u0101ras entered the seventh door without asking the doorkeepers, just as they had passed the previous doors. Seeing them, Jaya and Vijaya blocked their way. The Kum\u0101ras' desired to see Lord Visnu, but now they were stopped by Jaya and Vijaya. Their eyes turned red with anger, and they spoke to the doorkeepers, Why are you stopping us? Why do you suspect us? Where is the possibility of an enemy entering Vaikuntha? You both are in the highest position of service to Lord Visnu, but you have developed such a harsh mentality! You must be imposters. We curse you for leaving Vaikuntha and going to the material world. That is the right punishment for your mentality. Understanding that the terrible curse of the brahmanas cannot be counteracted, Jaya and Vijaya became fearful. They fell at the feet of the Kum\u0101ras and spoke, We have been disrespectful to you sages. We accept your punishment. But we pray that we don't forget the Lord even if we go to the material world. Please be compassionate on us. Seeing the genuine repentance of the doorkeepers, the Kum\u0101ras also repented for cursing them. Jaya and Vijaya were the dear devotees of Lord Visnu. The Kum\u0101ras' act of angrily cursing them was an offense. However, inner humility was aroused in the hearts of both the Kum\u0101ras and the doorkeepers. Both parties repented for offending each other. Understanding this situation at the door of Vaikuntha, Lord Vi\u015fnu arrived there along with Laksm\u012b. He wanted to stop further aggravation between the Kum\u0101ras and His doorkeepers. He also wanted to fulfill the desire of the Kum\u0101ras to see Him. The Kum\u0101ras were afraid that the Lord might be angry with them for cursing His devotees. Jaya and Vijaya were lamenting that they would have to be separated from the Lord due to the br\u0101hmanas' curse. The Lord pacified both the parties by His pleasing face and affectionate glance. The Kum\u0101ras saw Lord Visnu for the first time directly. He was blackish in complexion. He wore a yellow cloth, a fresh garland surrounded by bees, a charming necklace, and a Kaustubha jewel. He rested one hand on the shoulder of Garuda, and with the other, He twirled a lotus. The beauty of His cheeks enhanced the beauty of his fish-shaped earrings. His nose was prominent, and He wore a gem-studded crown on His head. The Lord's face was auspicious and pleasing, showering blessings upon everyone. His glance touched their hearts. When the breeze carrying the aroma of Tulasi leaves from the Lord's lotus feet entered the nostrils of Kum\u0101ras, they became pure devotees, They became greatly attracted to Visnu's form and saw His face, smile, and lotus feet again and again. Overwhelmed, they offered prayers to the Lord. O Lord, Your transcendental form can be seen only by Your mercy. Wherever we may be, let our minds be engaged in Your service, may our words always speak about You, and our ears hear about You. Understanding the fear of the Kum\u0101ras, Lord Visnu spoke to pacify them, I love brahma\u0146as and cows. I am displeased with those who disrespect them. My doorkeepers have offended you. Their offense is factually My offense. So I seek forgiveness from you. I approve of the punishment you have given them. But please let them come back to Vaikuntha soon. Being a responsible master, the Lord apologized to the Kum\u0101ras for the offense of His doorkeepers. But factually, He was not happy with the Kum\u0101ras' act of cursing His dear servants. The Kum\u0101ras were astonished and said, O Lord, You respect the br\u0101hma\u0146as just to set an example for others. You are most worshipable to the devat\u0101s and the br\u0101hmanas. You are the Lord of the three worlds and the maintainer of the universe. Your submissive behavior does not reduce your potency; and rather, it is Your divine pastime. We have cursed two faultless persons. We accept whatever punishment or reward You ordain on these innocent persons or also upon us. Lord Visnu replied, I sanction the punishment you have given them. But, unfortunately, because of your curse, they will become demons. But they will be absorbed in meditation on Me in anger and will shortly return to Me. The Kumaras circumambulated Lord Visnu and departed with His permission. They did not enter Vaikuntha but saw the Lord only at the gate. Although sometimes. brahma\u0146as and yogis go to Vaikuntha, they were not meant to stay there; they come back. The Lord then spoke to Jaya and Vijaya, Go to the material world but do not fear. Though I can nullify the curse, I shall not do so. Laksmi-devi foretold your departure. Once you stopped her from entering the gate, when I was sleeping, and she became angry. Although you will be in the material world as demons, you will always meditate on Me in anger and come back to Me shortly. DID YOU KNOW? GOD'S FIGHTING DESIRE The Lord is the source of everything. Anger and fighting spirit also exist in Him. But in Vaikuntha, the Lord has no enemies to fight with because everyone serves Him there with love. So, the Lord sometimes sends His devotees (like Jaya and Vijaya) to the material world and makes them temporarily act as His enemies. Only the devotees can satisfy the Lord in every respect, including giving Him the pleasure of fighting. So, the Lord comes as an incarnation, fights with them, and fulfills His desires. While doing this, He also gives several lessons to all of us. I shall experience the happiness fighting with you (vira-rasa) when I descend as three different avataras. Due to the curse of the Kumaras, Jaya and Vijaya appeared as demons in three lives as Hiranyak\u015fa and Hiranyaka\u015bipu, as R\u0101vana and Kumbhakarna, and as Sisup\u0101la and Dantavakra. The Lord fought with them and killed them in the form of Var\u0101ha, Narasimha, Roma, and Krsna.",
        "quotes": "Everything in the Vaikuntha is spiritual and personal. So there is no envy there.,  There is no envy or unhealthy competitive spirit in Vaikuntha. On the contrary, the residents of Vaikuntha encourage and appreciate each other in their service to Lord Vishnu. Therefore, one who wishes to go to Vaikuntha should develop such qualities of non-envy.,  The mistake of a follower leads people to blame the leader. So, one must act carefully not to cause a bad reputation to the leaders.

        "story": "Diti was one of the many wives of sage Ka\u015byapa. Seeing that her co-wives had children, she became distressed. She desired the fortune of having sons also. Thus, with an intense desire to have children and an envious attitude towards her co-wives, she approached Ka\u015byapa in the evening. At that time, Ka\u015byapa was sitting in a trance after having offered oblations in the sacrificial fire. Diti told him, All of us thirteen sisters are equally faithful to you. So why should I alone remain without a child? Ka\u015byapa pacified her and replied, I will satisfy your desire. But please wait for one muh\u016brta because this is the inauspicious time when ghosts move about. But impatient Diti didn't listen to his advice, and Ka\u015byapa also gave in to her demand. Afterward, Ka\u015byapa told Diti, You will give birth to two ferocious demons, who will torment the whole world. Lord Visnu will personally kill them. Diti repented for her impatience at an inauspicious time. Then, seeing her regret, Ka\u015byapa said,Although your sons will be cruel, your grandson will be a great devotee of Lord Visnu. His name will be Prahlada. He will have all noble qualities. He will bring happiness to everyone. Hearing this, Diti was somewhat pacified. In due course of time, Diti became pregnant. However, knowing that her sons will torment the universe and will be killed by the Lord, Diti didn't wish to deliver them. So she held her pregnancy for a hundred years. As a result, great darkness spread in all directions in the universe. All the devat\u0101s in the upper planets were confused. They approached Lord Brahma and asked him, Nothing is unknown to you. You know the intentions of everyone. Please tell us what is the cause of this darkness? Lord Brahma then narrated, Once the Kum\u0101ras went to Vaikuntha, but were stopped at the gate by the doorkeepers Jaya and Vijaya. The Kum\u0101ras became angry and cursed them to go to the material world Thus, Java and Vijaya have now entered the womb of Diti as demons. It is the prowess of these twin demons that have disturbed all of you. There is no remedy for this within my power. Only Lord Visnu can do something to counteract this. Let us wait for Him to take the necessary action. He is most merciful to all His devotees. Hearing this, the devat\u0101s gave up fear and returned to their respective places. Eventually, Diti gave birth to two powerful demons. Ka\u015byapa gave them names Hirany\u0101k\u1e63a and Hiranyaka\u015bipu. At that time, many fearful disturbances occurred on the earth and in outer space. Harsh winds blew with dust and storms and uprooted gigantic trees. Dense clouds covered all the luminaries in the sky, spreading darkness. The ocean, along with the aquatics, wailed loudly. She-jackals vomiting fire yelled inauspiciously along with the cries of jackals and owls. Dogs cried, and asses ran in herds, striking the earth with their hooves and wildly braying. Frightened by the braying of the asses, birds flew from their nests. Seeing these evil omens, everyone was afraid. The two demon brothers began to grow like mountains with bodies as strong as steel. With their gigantic forms, they seemed to kiss the sky with their crowns. Their steps shook the earth. Hirany\u0101k\u1e63a received a boon from Lord Brahm\u0101 and traveled all over the universe with a fighting spirit. Once, he went to heaven. Seeing his uncontrollable temper, gigantic form, huge mace, and bodily strength, all the devat\u0101s got frightened and fled away. After returning from heaven, Hirany\u0101k\u1e63a dove into the ocean to sport. The aquatics fled in fear. He moved into the ocean, striking the waves with his mace. He thus reached Vibh\u0101var\u012b, the capital of Varuna, the god of the ocean. There Hirany\u0101ksa fell at Varuna's feet, and to make fun of him, and he said, Give me battle, O Lord! You are a great ruler and a great warrior. Although provoked, Varuna controlled his anger and replied, We have now desisted from fighting, having grown too old. Only Lord Vi\u015fnu can satisfy your desire to fight. He appears in various incarnations to punish wicked fellows like you and to show His grace to the virtuous. Proud Hirany\u0101ksa then went to search for Lord Visnu to fight with Him. He learned from Narada Muni the whereabouts of the Lord and quickly entered the Garbhodaka ocean. There he saw the all-powerful Lord Visnu in the form of Varaha, bearing the earth on His tusks. He was N\u012bla Var\u0101ha or Rakta Var\u0101ha.Hirany\u0101ksa laughed and said, Oh, amphibious beast! This earth is entrusted to us. You cannot take it. Rascal! You have killed many demons by remaining invisible. O fool, today I shall kill You. When You die smashed by my mace, all the devat\u0101s and sages will also die, like trees without roots. Lord Var\u0101ha was pained by the shaft like abusive words of the demon. Seeing that the earth on His tusks was frightened, Lord Var\u0101ha rose out of the water and placed the earth on the surface of the water. He gave her the ability to float. The devat\u0101s rained flowers on Him. The Lord then replied to Hirany\u0101ksa, Indeed, We are jungle creatures searching for dogs like you. I have no fear from your loose talk. Give up all your foolish talk and fight Me if you can. Being thus challenged, Hiranyaksa became angry like a cobra. He quickly sprang upon the Lord with his powerful mace. They struck each other with their huge maces. Lord Brahm\u0101, accompanied by the sages, came to see the terrible fight. Brahm\u0101 then addressed Lord Var\u0101ha, O Lord, this demon is an offender of devat\u0101s, devotees, br\u0101hma\u0146as, cows and sinless living beings. Having attained a boon from me, he wanders all over the universe, searching for a proper combatant. There is no need to play with him. Please kill him as soon as possible and establish the world in peace. Lord Var\u0101ha accepted Brahm\u0101's prayer. Var\u0101hadeva sprang and aimed His mace at the chin of Hirany\u0101ksa. But the demon struck back with his mace, and the Lord's mace slipped from His hand. This was miraculous! Though Hirany\u0101k\u1e63a had the opportunity, he did not strike the unarmed Lord, respecting the law of single combat. Instead, the Lord acknowledged the demon's dharma and invoked His Sudar\u015bana cakra. The people who witnessed this great fight cried, May victory attend You, O Lord! Please kill the demon. Seeing the Lord with His cakra, Hirany\u0101ksa began to hiss like a serpent and bit his lip. Then, he sprang into the air and aimed his mace at the Lord, exclaiming, You are dead! The Lord effortlessly knocked down the mace with His left foot and said, Take up your weapon and try again. Hirany\u0101ksa again attacked the Lord by his mace, and the Lord playfully caught hold of that mace. His valor thus frustrated, Hirany\u0101ksa then invoked a deadly trident and threw it at the Lord. The Lord cut that trident with His cakra. Hirany\u0101ksa struck the Lord's chest with his hard fist and disappeared created many illusions against the Lord. Fierce winds Hirany\u0101k\u1e63a then created blew; stones fell as if shot by machine guns. Clouds, accompanied by lightning and thunder, started raining pus, hair, blood, stool, urine, and bones. Mountains discharged various weapons. Lord Varaha then invoked cakra that destroyed all those illusions. Frustrated, Hirany\u0101k\u1e63a started to strike the Lord's chest with his hard fists, but the Lord then slapped him in the root of the ear. Though struck indifferently, Hirany\u0101k\u1e63a's eyeballs bulged out, his arms and legs broken, hair scattered, and he fell down dead like an uprooted tree. Seeing the dead body of Hirany\u0101ksa, Brahm\u0101 and others admiringly said: Oh, who could meet such a blessed death? He was struck by a forefoot of the Lord and died while seeing the Lord's beautiful face. The devat\u0101s then praised Lord Var\u0101ha. After that, Var\u0101hadeva, having enjoyed his fight with the demon, went back to His eternal abode.",

        "title": "A Marriage Arranged By God",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 3",
        "story": "After Var\u0101hadeva rescued the earth planet, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu started residing on earth along with his queen Satar\u016bpa. He stayed at a place called Brahm\u0101varta and made a city called Barhismati his capital Barhismati was named so because Lord Varaha's hair dropped there and got transformed into sacred ku\u015ba grass. In this place, Manu spread a seat of ku\u015ba grass and worshipped the Lord. Although he was involved in managing a vast kingdom, he never lost focus on his bhakti. He used to hear about Lord Krsna daily in the morning. He was absorbed in hearing, contemplating, writing, and chanting about the Lord's pastimes. He thus passed his long time, which lasted 71 divya-yugas. He never experienced any miseries. Asked by the sages, Manu taught the diverse duties of different sections of human society. His book is called Manu-samhita. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu had five children three daughters namely Devah\u016bti, \u0100k\u016bti and Pras\u016bti, and two sons namely Priyavrata and Utt\u0101nap\u0101da. \u00c4k\u016bti married sage Ruci, Pras\u016bti married Daksa, and Devah\u016bti married Kardama Muni. Kardama Muni was one of the sons of Lord Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 ordered him to marry and get good children and populate the universe. Before entering married life, Kardama worshiped Lord Visnu near a lake called Bindu-sarovara, encircled by River Sarasvati. The shore of the lake was filled with pious trees and creepers, rich in flowers and fruits of all seasons. The surroundings resounded with the sweet singing of overjoyed birds like peacocks, cuckoos, ducks, swans, ospreys, cranes, cakoras, and bees. In such a pleasant ambiance, Kardama worshiped Lord Visnu for ten thousand years. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Visnu appeared in front of Kardama Muni. The Lord was as effulgent as the sun, garlanded with white lotuses, and dressed in yellow silk garments. Dark locks of hair surrounded his lotus face. Adorned with a dazzling crown and shining earrings, He was holding \u015bankha, cakra, gad\u0101, and padma in His four hands. He was endowed with \u015ar\u012bvatsa mark on His chest and a Kaustubha jewel hanging from His neck. He stood on the shoulders of Garuda, His mighty eagle carrier. Kardama became joyful, and with folded hands, he offered prayers, \u039f Lord, my eyes have become successful by seeing You. My father Brahm\u0101 instructed me to marry and create good progeny. Therefore, I worshipped You desiring to marry a girl of a like disposition. Brahm\u0101 also works under Your instruction. Therefore, my desire to marry is, in turn, Your desire to populate the universe. Hearing the sincere request of Kardama, Lord Visnu smiled affectionately and spoke, I know your desire and have already arranged for it. The desires of those who serve Me in devotion are never frustrated. The day after tomorrow, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu and his queen, \u015aatar\u016bp\u0101, will come here to see you. They have a marriageable, beautiful, and qualified daughter named Devah\u016bti. She is suitable to be your wife, and her parents will conduct your marriage. Thus, you both will have nine wonderful daughters who will get married to nine great sages. They will increase the population of the universe. Impressed with his bhakti, the Lord gave Kardama an additional boon, I shall appear as your son (Kapila). I shall instruct Devah\u016bti in spiritual knowledge. At the end of your life, you will attain Me in My eternal abode. Having said this, the Lord departed from Bindu sarovara to Vaikuntha. The Lord, who was overwhelmed by mercy for Kardama, shed tears that mixed with the lake's water. Therefore, that holy lake was called Bindu-sarovara. Kardama stayed at Bindu-sarovara, waiting for the arrival of Svayambhuva Manu. Finally, on the day predicted by Lord Vi\u015fnu, Manu came to Kardama's hermitage, with his wife Satar\u016bp\u0101 and daughter Devah\u016bti. Manu saw Kardama's body shining, healthy, tall, with lotus eyes, matted hair, and tattered cloth. Kardama Muni received him respectfully and said, Dear Manu, saintly kings like you embody the protecting energy of Lord Sri Hari. As a perfect representative of the Lord, you are always busy protecting righteous people and punishing the unrighteous. So tell me, why have you come here? Whatever it may be, I shall carry it out. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu felt embarrassed to hear Kardama's praise and said, O great sage, the Lord has created you br\u0101hma\u0146as to propagate the Vedas. He has created the k\u1e63atriyas to protect the brahmanas. The br\u0101hmanas are said to be the Lord's heart and the ksatriyas His arms. They protect each other, and the Lord protects them through each other. By my fortune, I heard from you the duties of a king. Manu then requested Kardama, Please accept my daughter Devah\u016bti as your wife. She is seeking a suitable husband in terms of age, character and qualities. When she heard from Narada Muni about you, she fixed her mind upon you. She will be a suitable wife for you in every way. I know that you also have a desire to marry. Kardama replied, Certainly, I desire to marry, and your daughter is a perfect match for me. She is endowed with all good qualities. Who would reject her? Her beauty excels the beauty of her ornaments. She is the very ornament of womanhood. Therefore, our marriage can take place according to the Vedic system. But I have a condition. I will stay with her only till she gives birth to children. After that, I shall dedicate my life to bhakti and worship Lord Visnu. Manu, \u015aatar\u016bp\u0101 and Devah\u016bti all became happy with this. Manu conducted the marriage of Devah\u016bti and Kardama at that very place. Empress \u015aatar\u016bp\u0101 lovingly gave the most valuable presents, such as jewelry, clothes, and household articles. Manu affectionately embraced his daughter with tears in his eyes, unable to bear separation from her. After that, Manu and Satar\u016bp\u0101 returned to their capital Brahm\u0101varta.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 3",
        "story": "After her parents departed, chaste Devah\u016bti served her husband Kardama Muni with great love, respect and intimacy. Thus, serving for a long time, she grew weak and emaciated. Seeing her condition, Kardama became kind and said, I am very pleased with you. You have served me without caring for your own body. I shall offer you all the blessings that I have attained from the Lord through my meditation and worship. Upon hearing her husband, Devah\u016bti was very happy and satisfied. Then, feeling shy, she innocently spoke to Kardama, You have attained many blessings by your devotional service. However, I desire to have children first, since it is praiseworthy quality for a chaste woman. Desiring to please his devoted wife, Kardama Muni created with his mystic power a gigantic aerial mansion that could travel at his will. That airplane has seven stories and was bedecked with jewels. Its pillars were adorned with precious stones, doors bedecked with diamonds, and contained all necessary paraphernalia for enjoyment. There were live swans and pigeons, and artificial swans and pigeons too. The real birds thought of the artificial ones as live like them, and the palace vibrated with the sounds of these birds. Even after seeing this beautiful airplane, Devah\u016bti was not happy because her body was still emaciated. Understanding this, Kardama told her, Please take a bath in Bindu-sarovara, created by Lord Visnu Himself, and then mount the airplane. Devah\u016bti entered that lake with her matted hair and dirty clothes. Inside the lake was a house with thousand young girls fragrant like lotuses. They said to Devah\u016bti with folded hands, We are your servants. The girls then bathed Devah\u016bti with valuable oils and ointments and gave her new clothes, excellent jewels, good food, and sweet drink. In a mirror, Devah\u016bti saw herself clean, well dressed, garlanded, and decorated with necklaces, bangles, golden anklets, and tilaka. Her face shone with beautiful teeth, charming eyes, eyebrows, and locks of hair. Thus she regained her beauty as a princess. Devah\u016bti then remembered her husband. She was immediately transported, along with all the maidservants, to the place where he was. Devah\u016bti was amazed to see Kardama's yogic power. Kardama then took her into the airplane. Surrounded by his wife and many girls, he looked like the moon amidst many stars. In that aerial mansion, Devah\u016bti and Kardama visited many beautiful spots in the universe. They saw the pleasure valleys of Mount Meru and other celestial gardens like Vai\u015brambhaka, Surasana, Nandana, and Puspa-bhadraka. Kardama surpassed even devat\u0101s in enjoyment. After showing to Devah\u016bti the whole world and its variegated features and many wonders, Kardama returned to his hermitage. In due course of time, Devah\u016bti gave birth to nine beautiful daughters namely Kala Anas\u016by\u0101, \u015braddh\u0101, Havirbh\u016b, Gati, Kriy\u0101, Khy\u0101ti, Arundhati, and S\u00e4nti. After that, Devah\u016bti worshiped Lord Visnu under her husband's directions. Finally, after some years, the Supreme Lord appeared as her son Kapila. Celebrating His appearance, all the devat\u0101s played musical instruments and danced in joy. Celestial beings showered flowers. Lord Brahm\u0101 arrived there along with many sages. Brahm\u0101 said to Kardama, My dear son, you have honored me by following my instructions without duplicity. Your nine daughters are chaste and will increase the population of the universe in various ways. Get them married to the sages, according to their likings. Lord Kapila, with golden hair, has now appeared as your son. Brahm\u0101 said to Devah\u016bti, O fortunate Devah\u016bti, the Lord who appeared in your womb, will give you spiritual knowledge. He will increase your fame and travel all over the world. Brahma then departed for Satyaloka on his swan carrier along with N\u0101rada and Kum\u0101ras. Kardama Muni got his nine daughters married to nine powerful sages. Kal\u0101 married sage Mar\u012bci, Anas\u016by\u0101 married Atri, \u015araddh\u0101 married Angir\u0101, Havirbh\u016b married Pulastya, Gati married Pulaha, Kriy\u0101 married Kratu, Khy\u0101ti married Bhrgu, Arundhati married Vasistha, and \u015a\u0101nti married Atharv\u0101. Kardama took care of the daughters and sons-in-law for some time, and then they departed to their homes. After that, Kardama approached his son Kapila in a secluded place, offered obeisances, and spoke, O Lord, You have mercifully appeared in my house. You appear in innumerable forms to please Your devotees. I surrender unto You. Now I wish to retire from household life and become a sanny\u0101s\u012b to dedicate my life to bhakti completely. Please give me Your permission. Although the Lord was in his home, still Kardama Muni wanted to leave home to meditate on the Lord. Because he always worshiped the Lord in the mood of a servant (d\u0101sya-rasa). So it wouldn't be natural for him to see the Lord as his son (v\u0101tsalya-rasa) staying at home. Lord Kapila replied, Now, you may go as you desire. You will always see Me within your heart and will soon attain Me. I have incarnated as your son to revive spiritual knowledge which was lost. I shall describe this knowledge to My mother so that she will also attain perfection. Kardama Muni circumambulated Lord Kapila and left for the forest. He took complete shelter of the Lord in devotion. He thus became liberated by bhakti and went to the spiritual realm. Lord Kapila later taught His mother Devah\u016bti about s\u0101nkhya-yogo (analytical knowledge of matter and spirit), ast\u0101nga-yoga (meditation on the Lord), and ultimately bhakti-yoga (devotional service unto the Lord), Lord Kapila then took permission from His mother and left for a place called Ganga-s\u0101gara. Even now, Lord Kapila is staying there in a trance for the welfare of the three worlds. Saintly Devah\u016bti performed bhakti, as instructed by her glorious son. She was sorry that her son was separated from her. Yet meditating upon Him, she attained the Lord. The material elements of her body melted into the water of the flowing river. Anyone who bathes there also attains perfection.",

        "story": "Anas\u00fcy\u00e4, one of the nine daughters of Devah\u016bti, married sage Atri. Atri Muni had a desire to have a son exactly like the Lord of the universe, Jagad\u012b\u015bvara. To please Him, Atri and Anas\u00fcya went to Rksa mountain where the river Nirvindhy\u0101 flows. Atri performed severe austerities, controlled his mind and breath, and stood on one leg for a hundred years, eating nothing but air. By his tapasya, a blazing fire came out of Atri's head, burning the three worlds. Lord Vi\u015fnu is the ultimate Lord of the universe, Jagadi\u015bvara. He perceived Atri's penance fire and directed the other two Lords \u015aiva and Brahm\u00e4, to come before Atri Muni along with Him. Thus, the three principal deities of the universe, Brahm\u0101, Vi\u015fnu, and \u015aiva, went to Atri's hermitage, along with several devat\u0101s like Gandharvas, Siddhas, Vidy\u0101dharas and N\u0101gas. Atri, who was standing on one leg, saw the three deities and was astonished. Lord \u015aiva was sitting on a bull holding a drum. Brahm\u00e4 sat on a swan with ku\u015ba grass in his hands. Lord Visnu sat on Garuda holding His Sudar\u015bana cakra. Finally, Atri Muni offered them respect by falling flat on the ground. He eagerly approached them but closed his eyes for a moment due to their dazzling effulgence. Gathering his senses, with folded palms, he offered prayers in sweet words, I called for one Lord, desiring a son like Him. But now I see three divine personalities. I offer respect to all of you. But please be merciful upon me and tell me whom did I call among you three. I am bewildered. Hearing his words, the three Lords smiled and replied, Dear Atri, whatever you wished will be fulfilled. We Brahm\u0101, Vi\u015fnu, and \u015aiva oversee the activities of creation, maintenance, and destruction of this universe. So, anyone of us may be considered the Lord of the universe, Jagad\u012b\u015bvara. You didn't specifically mention whom you wanted, so all three of us came before you. Atri called for Jagad-\u012b\u015bvara, but he was not sure who that Jagad-\u012b\u015bvara was. He didn't know who among the three deities was the Supreme. Still, he wanted a son like Jagad-\u012b\u015bvara. So, the three Lords granted his desires. They spoke to him, All three of us will appear as your sons and manifest our potencies partially. By those three sons, your reputation will increase. Then the three Lords disappeared. Later the three Lords Visnu, Brahm\u0101, and \u015aiva appeared as Atri's three sons, namely Datt\u0101treya, Soma, and Durv\u0101s\u0101 respectively.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "Pras\u016bti was one of the three daughters of Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu. Manu got her married to Prajapati Daksa. Pras\u016bti and Daksa had sixteen beautiful daughters. One of the daughters, Sat\u012b, married Lord Siva. The first fifteen daughters gave birth to many sons, but the youngest daughter Sat\u012b didn't have children. Daksa was very affectionate to his youngest daughter Sati. On the other hand, Lord Siva was gentle, non-envious, peaceful, and self-satisfied. He was a teacher of the whole world and the greatest of the devat\u0101s. But Daksa always envied Lord \u015aiva because of his exalted position. Thus, there was a bitter quarrel between the son-in-law and father-in-law that ultimately led to the death of Sat\u012b. Once several sages, demigods, and other leaders of the universe assembled to perform a thousand-year sacrifice. Daksa entered that sacrificial arena, shining like the sun. The entire assembly was illuminated. Everyone there, except Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, stood up respectfully to welcome Daksa. Daksa went to his father Brahma and offered respects. At that time, Lord \u015aiva was meditating on the Supreme Lord. Seeing \u015aiva not standing up to honor him, Daksa became enraged and gazed with eyes to burn \u015aiva. But humble people do not expect respect. On the pretext of speaking about good manners and a culture of respect, Daksa criticized Lord \u015aiva. He said, O sages and devat\u0101s, I am not speaking out of ignorance or envy. This \u015aiva is unclean, shameless, impure, proud, and has no manners. Like a madman, sometimes laughs and sometimes cries. He smears crematorium ashes, wears a garland of skulls and bones. He is dear to ghosts and crazy beings who are in ignorance. Pretending to be an honest person, this monkey-eyed man has married my fawn-eyed daughter Sati. He thus accepted himself as my subordinate, but now he has failed to respect me even with words. Therefore, though not desiring, I gave my daughter to this unqualified man, at the request of Brahm\u0101. Dak\u015fa thus criticized and insulted Lord \u015aiva, but \u015aiva remained tolerant and didn't speak a single word in retaliation. On the contrary, to the astonishment of everyone, Daksa even cursed \u015aiva saying, Let this \u015aiva, the lowest of all the devat\u0101s, not have a share in the sacrificial oblations. Daksa then angrily left the assembly, although the assembly leaders opposed it. Nand\u012b\u015bvara, the devout servant of Lord \u015aiva, became very angry. He thus counter-cursed Daksa and his followers, Let Daksa have a goat head very soon. Anyone who has supported Daksa and neglected Lord Siva are foolish. They will be bereft of spiritual knowledge and will be attached to superficial rituals. They will become beggars and will have no discrimination in eating. Seeing Nandi cursing the brahma\u0146as, sage Bhrgu counter-cursed Lord \u0160iva's followers, Let the followers of Lord Siva become atheists. Since they criticized brahma\u0146as and Vedas, let them be diverted from scriptural injunctions and become addicted to wine and flesh. When such cursing and counter-cursing were going on, Lord Siva became morose. To find no means of stopping it, he just got up and left the place. Despite the absence of Lord \u015aiva and Daksa, the other members performed the thousand-year sacrifice. After completing the yaj\u00f1a, they took their bath at the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna and went to their respective abodes.",

Such people do not realize that they are bringing about their own ruination by their arrogance. Daksa was an example of this. In contrast, Lord Siva was humble and tolerant. Learning from \u015aiva, we should cultivate humility and stay far away from arrogance.",

        "story": "Once Daksa performed a sacrifice called v\u00f5japeya. He followed it up with a greater sacrifice called brhaspati-sava. He invited many great sages, devat\u0101s, and their wives for the sacrifice, but he didn't invite Lord \u0160iva or his followers. Being so arrogant, he continued to be hateful towards Siva. Sati, the beloved wife of Lord Siva, heard the heavenly denizens conversing about Daksa's sacrifice. She also saw the wives of many devat\u0101s going there well dressed and ornamented. Being the youngest daughter of Dak\u015fa, she also desired to go for her father's sacrifice. Innocent Sati approached \u015aiva and said, It is your father-in-law's sacrifice conducted by great sages. My sisters must have gone there with their husbands. I see that several devat\u0101s are also going. I also want to decorate myself and go there with you. I wish to see my mother, sisters, aunts, and other relatives. I desire to see my birth place. Please be kind to me. How can a daughter be undisturbed hearing of a festive event at her father's house? Thinking that \u015aiva might say that Daksa had not invited them, Sati said, There's no harm in going to the house of a friend or father even without an invitation. You have accepted me as your better half, and please oblige me. Lord \u015aiva replied smilingly, It is true that one could go to a friend's house uninvited. But if the host finds fault with the guest and looks at the guest with angry eyes, one shouldn't go to such a person's house. Sati: But my father will not find faults in us because he has wisdom. \u0160iva: Noble people have six great qualities namely austerity, wealth, knowledge, beauty, youth and heritage. But if one is proud, these qualities become faults in them, and they can't see any good in others. Sati: But even the low-minded people have affection for their children. I am the favorite daughter of my father. Therefore, even if he speaks some unkind words, I shall tolerate. Siva: Harsh words of one's relatives are more painful than the harsh words of enemies. They continue to pain one's heart day and night. Sati: I will go alone. You need not come. \u015aiva: I understand that you are the beloved daughter of Daksa, but because of your connection with me, he will dishonor you. Sati: You are speaking like this due to your anger towards my father. \u015aiva: I have no anger on your father. But he hates me. An egoistic person cannot tolerate the greatness of others. Being unable to rise to their standard, such people envy others. Sati: I believe that you do not hate my father. However, he is your father-in-law, so you should have risen from your seat to respect him when he entered the sacrificial arena. \u015aiva: In pure consciousness, I am always offering obeisances to Lord V\u0101sudeva, who is within everyone's heart. Because I was absorbed in thinking of Vasudeva, I was respecting Daksa too. Sati was silent and couldn't say anything. \u0160iva finally said, Please do not go to your father's sacrifice. Because of envy, he has insulted me with cruel words, and he will mistreat you also. If you neglect my words and go, your future will not be good. Disrespect from a relative is as good as dead. In this way, Lord \u015aiva, being a genuine well-wisher of his beloved wife, advised her. But Sati was anxious to see her relatives and was also afraid of \u015aiva's caution. In confusion, she moved in and out of the home. Upset at being forbidden, she cried out of affection for her relatives. Her body was shaking as she glanced at \u015aiva in great anger as if to burn him. Tormented by the extreme emotions, her intelligence was bewildered, and Sat\u012b left \u015aiva, who had given her half of his body. Because of this, later Sat\u012b was insulted by Daksa and had to give up her body voluntarily.",

It's a great fortune to have expert guidance in our decision-making. If we are open to experienced well-wishers' advice and seek their help in decision-making, we can avoid a lot of turmoil.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "Sati decided to go to Daksa's sacrifice, neglecting Lord Siva's advice. \u0160iva didn't further try to stop her. He understood that Sati was overwhelmed by her emotions for relatives. But he wanted to protect her. So he gave indications to his followers Nandi, Manim\u00e4n, and others to safely take Sati to Daksa's sacrifice. The associates of Siva then followed Sati, who was going to her father's house. She was made to sit on the bull Nandi and was given her pet bird s\u00e4rik\u0101, a ball, lotus, mirror, white umbrella, fan, and a garland. A singing party accompanied her, and the whole procession was as pompous as a royal parade. Sati thus reached Dak\u015fa's sacrificial arena, which was splendid with the chanting of Vedic hymns, and the presence of great sages and devat\u0101s. But no one came forward to received Sati out of fear of Daksa. Only her mother, sisters, and aunts came and hugged her with affection and gladdened faces. They offered her a seat and many gifts, but she didn't accept any of them. She did not even reply to their words of reception because her father did not welcome her due to his hatred for her husband. She could now understand why \u015aiva told her not to come there. Sati also noticed that in that sacrifice, there were no oblations in the name of Lord Siva. Although she had neglected Siva's advice due to her desire, she had a great love for him. Therefore, she couldn't tolerate Dak\u015fa's offenses towards Lord Siva. She became furious and looked at Dak\u015fa as if to burn him. Seeing her anger, Lord Siva's followers became ready to kill Daksa, but she stopped them. Being sorrowful, she condemned Daksa, Who except you would hate Lord Siva? There is no rival for Siva in this universe. He is the most beloved of all. Although you criticized him as inauspicious, everyone, including Brahm\u0101, considers him auspicious. S\u0101dhus, like him, find no faults in others but magnify even meager good qualities in others. But a proud man like you finds faults even in great souls. Therefore, offense to exalted personalities will ruin you. Pointing out Daksa's offensive mentality, Sat\u012b said, You have blasphemed a great Vaisnava. One must cut the tongue or kill an offender like you. If that is not possible, one must block one's ears and leave the place, or give up one's own life as an atonement for hearing the criticism. Because you happen to be my father, I do not wish to kill you. So, I shall give up my body. My body is a source of embarrassment since it comes from a person who has offended \u015aiva. Sati had the potency to vanquish many universes, including many Daksas. But to save her husband from the charge that he killed Daksa through his wife, Sat\u012b did not kill Daksa but decided to give up her own life. Sat\u012b thus sat down facing north. Dressed in saffron garments, she sat in meditation and invoked fire within her body. Then, thinking about the holy feet of her husband, she gave up her body in that fire. Seeing Sat\u012b's voluntary death, people in the universe said, Daksa was so disrespectful to his honorable daughter, that she had to give up her body. Hard-hearted Dak\u015fa is unworthy to be a br\u0101hma\u0146a. He was so envious and hateful of Lord \u015aiva that he didn't even attempt to stop his daughter from committing suicide. While people were thus talking, Lord Siva's attendants prepared to kill Daksa. Seeing them swiftly approaching to attack Daksa, Bhrgu Muni offered oblations into the fire with hymns from the Yajur Veda to kill them. As a result, many thousands of powerful men called Rbhus appeared and chased all the followers of \u015aiva in all directions. N\u0101rada Muni informed Lord \u015aiva about Sat\u012b's death. \u015aiva became furious. He tolerated Daksa's offense towards himself earlier, but now he couldn't tolerate Daksa's mistreatment of Sati. \u015aiva plucked a hair from his head and threw it on the ground in great anger. From that hair, a fearsome black demon named Virabhadra appeared. V\u012brabhadra was as high as the sky and as bright as three suns, with hair like blazing fire, fearsome teeth, a garland of skulls, and thousands of arms equipped with weapons. Virabhadra asked Lord \u015aiva with folded hands, What shall I do? \u015aiva ordered, Kill Daksa and his soldiers. Virabhadra then circumambulated \u015aiva and departed for Daksa's sacrificial arena. Virabhadra carried a fearful trident and was accompanied by the associates of \u015aiva. They all made a thundering sound and created a great dust storm causing darkness. Everybody in Dak\u015fa's sacrificial arena wondered, Where is this dust coming from? This cannot be because of wind or thieves. Pras\u016bti and other women said. This danger is the result of Daksa's sin. He insulted innocent Sati and caused her death. He neglected the honor of Lord Siva. How can anyone have fortune after angering Siva? He can scatter the planets by the movements of his eyebrows. While people were thus speaking, Daksa saw dangerous omens from all sides, from the earth and the sky. Virabhadra and his army, holding various weapons, ran all around Daksa's sacrificial arena and began to create great disturbances. They destroyed pillars, halls, kitchens, homes, and sacrificial paraphernalia. Finally, they extinguished the sacrificial fire, blocked the fleeing priests' way, and arrested the devat\u0101s. of Lord Siva. Maniman arrested Bhrgu Muni, and Virabhadra arrested Daksa. Cande\u015ba arrested P\u016b\u1e63\u0101 and Nand\u012b\u015bvara arrested Bhaga. V\u012brabhadra tore off the mustache of Bhrgu, who had smiled showing his mustache when Daksa insulted \u015aiva. Next, V\u012brabhadra plucked out the eyes of Bhaga, who had encouraged Daksa by the movement of his eyebrows. Next, he knocked out the teeth of Pusa, who had shown his teeth by smiling. V\u012brabhadra then sat on the chest of Daksa and beheaded him. Seeing this, the followers of Lord \u015aiva expressed great joy, while others expressed grief. V\u012brabhadra then offered Daksa's head in the sacrificial fire as an oblation, and departed for Kail\u0101sa, the abode of Lord \u015aiva.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "After Virabhadra had destroyed Daksa's sacrifice, all the injured devat\u0101s, priests and guests approached Lord Brahma. They informed him of what had happened and asked for his help. Lord Brahma spoke to them, How can you expect any happiness if you offend a great personality like Lord Siva? He is especially sorry because of losing his wife and the harsh words spoken by Daksa. Therefore, you should fall at his feet and beg his pardon. But, nevertheless, he is pleased easily and therefore he is called \u0100\u015butosa. Brahma then took all of them and went to Kailasa, the abode of Lord \u0160iva. The Kailasa Hill was resounding with Vedic hymns. Its scenic ambiance is filled with varieties of flower-bearing and fruit-bearing trees, caves, minerals, jewels, lakes filled with lotuses, waterfalls, animals, and sweet vibrations of various birds like peacocks and cuckoos. It was surrounded by River Alakanand\u0101 (Ganga). Passing through the beautiful Kailasa region, the devat\u0101s approached Lord Siva. He was sitting under a 100 yojanas wide banyan tree (one yojana 8 miles). He seemed peaceful. He was sitting in vir\u0101sana, with his left leg on his right thigh and his left hand on his left thigh. In his right hand, he held rudr\u0101k\u1e63a beads. He sat on a ku\u015ba mat and was speaking about bhakti to Narada Muni and other sages. The devat\u0101s and sages offered respects to Lord \u015aiva. Despite his exalted position, \u0160iva stood up and bowed down in front of Brahm\u0101. Lord Brahm\u0101 was smiling to conceal his fear as he was afraid that Lord \u015aiva might be in an angry mood. Brahm\u0101 spoke to \u015aiva, Please spare sinful Daksa. Great devotees of Vi\u015fnu like yourself do not become angry with other beings. You are very exalted. You need not kill sinful people, as they are already killed by providence because of their mean-mindedness, envy, and harsh speech. People like you are very kind to even offenders like Daksa. Please be merciful upon them. Let Dak\u015fa get back his life, Bhaga his eyes, Bhrgu his mustache, P\u016b\u1e63\u0101 his teeth. May the injured devat\u0101s recover. Please take your share of the sacrifice, and let your grace complete the sacrifice. Being thus requested by Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva smilingly spoke, I do not mind the offenses of the devat\u0101s, as they are childish and less intelligent. Therefore, I have punished them only to correct them. Lord \u015aiva then fulfilled the requests of Lord Brahm\u0101, Let Daksa have a goat's head because he had the words and intelligence of a goat. Let Bhaga see with Mitra's eyes. Let P\u016bs\u0101 chew through the teeth of his disciples or Daksa, or eat chickpea dough if he is alone. He has shown his teeth while laughing at the devotees. Let the devat\u0101s have their limbs restored as they did not side with Daksa when he criticized me. Let Bhrgu have the mustache of a goat as he was the chief advisor of Daksa. The assembled people approved \u015aiva's words. Then all of them, including \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101, proceeded to the sacrificial arena. Daksa's body was joined to the head of a goat. Then, Daksa awoke as if from sleep and saw Lord \u015aiva. Daksa's heart had been contaminated by hatred for \u015aiva, but it was cleansed now. He remembered the ill-fated death of his daughter and shed tears. Gaining composure, Daksa began to praise \u015aiva, I am an offender. Your punishment to me is your mercy upon me. You always protect the br\u0101hma\u0146as. Not knowing the truth about you, I insulted you. But you were tolerant. Please be satisfied by your own mercy, for I cannot satisfy you with my words. Being pardoned by Lord Siva and with the permission of Brahma, Daksa again began the sacrifice. He offered ghee in the sacrificial fire with Yajur Veda mantras, Then Lord Visnu appeared on His Garuda bird carrier, illuminating all the directions. He was blackish, dressed in yellow, and wore a crown as dazzling as the sun. In His eight hands (like eight petals of a lotus), He held conch, disc, club, lotus, arrow, bow, shield, and sword. His body appeared like a blue lotus flower. His face was decorated with a beautiful smile and captivating glance. He had a white canopy overhead like the moon. The devat\u0101s offered their respectful prayers to Lord Visnu according to their capacities. Lord Visnu then instructed Daksa, If a devotee worships Me, but disrespects \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101, I am not pleased. Therefore, never commit such offenses again. Daksa then worshipped Lord Visnu, and also Lord Siva, Lord Brahm\u0101, and the other devat\u0101s and concluded his sacrifice. Then all the assembled people blessed Dak\u015fa and departed. Sati was reborn as P\u0101rvat\u012b in the womb of Menaka, the wife of Him\u0101la P\u0101rvat\u012b married Lord \u015aiva again and lived happily with him.",

What to speak of Siva and Brahma, one shouldn't disrespect any living being. Every living entity is a child of God and is spiritual in nature, although caught up in a material body. Acknowledging everyone's eternal relationship with God, we must duly respect all living beings according to their positions. Disrespecting others out of pride and envy leads to one's own fall down.",

        "title": "The Decision of A Disappointed Boy",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "King Uttanapada had two queens - Sun\u012bti and Suruci. The younger queen Suruci was very dear to Uttanapada, while Sun\u012bti was not his favorite. Sun\u012bti had a son named Dhruva , and Suruci's son was Uttama. Once, Uttanapada sat on his throne with Uttama on his lap. As he was patting Uttama affectionately, little Dhruva arrived there. Five-year-old Dhruva also desired to sit on his father's lap like his step-brother. So he tried to get on Uttanap\u0101da's lap, but the King did not welcome him. Utt\u0101nap\u0101da was affectionate towards both of his sons, but despite his favoritism towards Suruci, he could not welcome Dhruva, despite his feelings. Seeing Dhruva's innocent desire and attempt, Suruci became very envious. She started speaking with great pride while Utt\u0101nap\u0101da listened. Suruci said to Dhruva, O child, although you are also the son of the King, you don't deserve to sit on his lap or the throne because you are not born of me! Being a mere child, you are unaware of the difference between your mother and me. Therefore, your desire is impossible to fulfill. If you still wish to sit on the King's lap, then worship Lord Visnu, and by His mercy, take birth as my son in your next life. Suruci indirectly told Dhruva first to die and then take his next birth in her womb. She wasn't a great devotee of Lord Visnu, but she recommended Dhruva to worship the Lord, just to impress Utt\u0101nap\u0101da that she was a devotee. Pierced by Suruci's harsh words, Dhruva breathed heavily in anger, like a snake struck by a stick. Utt\u0101nap\u0101da's silence made him even more disappointed. Being a king and a father, Utt\u0101nap\u0101da could have been responsible for forbidding Suruci when she was so harsh to Dhruva unnecessarily. But Utt\u0101nap\u0101da didn't do anything to comfort Dhruva. Disheartened, Dhruva immediately went to his mother weeping. By the time Dhruva reached Sun\u012bti, the palace residents had informed her about the incident. Hearing this, Sun\u012bti became aggrieved. When she saw Dhruva crying in distress, Sun\u012bti lifted him onto her lap. Losing her patience, she lamented, remembering the harsh words of her co-wife. She burned in grief like a creeper burned by a forest fire and shed tears. Not knowing any remedy for the painful situation, Sun\u012bti tried to console Dhruva. She said, My dear child, please do not wish ill fortune for others. One suffers pain as a result of one's own past mistakes. You have taken birth from an unfortunate woman. Your father feels ashamed to accept me as his wife or even as a maidservant. What Suruci has said is true. If you desire to sit on the same throne as your stepbrother, follow Suruci's advice of worshipping Lord Vasudeva without being envious of her. Recommending bhakti, Sun\u012bti told Dhruva, Only by worshipping Lord Vasudeva, your great-grandfather Brahm\u0101 could create the universe, and your grandfather Manu achieved happiness and liberation. So, you also take shelter of the Lord. He is very kind to His devotees. So, keep Him in your heart, and perform bhakti without deviation. His affection for His devotees is more than the affection of millions of mothers put together. No one else is capable of extinguishing your distress except the lotus-eyed Lord. Even Laksmi, who is worshiped by several devat\u0101s, serves Lord Vasudeva. Although Sun\u012bti advised Dhruva not to be envious of Suruci, Dhruva still held anger towards Suruci. This was due to his nature as a ksatriya prince. But he took Sun\u012bti's advice of worshiping Lord Visnu very seriously. Because he was not allowed to sit on his father's lap or throne, he desired to sit in a much superior position. He thought, I must attain a position which is superior to even Brahma's position. So Dhruva decided to leave home and enter the forest to worship the Lord with this determined desire.",

Therefore, one must learn to speak politely., The behavior of elders in front of children impacts their minds.

But noble-hearted people like Sun\u012bti do not hold any negative feelings towards even those who hurt them. Their tolerance and mature consciousness can gradually bring transformation in others too. Such great persons humbly take shelter of God and direct others also towards God's shelter. With their devotional consciousness, they can convert adversity into an advantage for themselves and others.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "With an ambitious desire to attain a position greater than Lord Brahm\u0101, little Dhruva left home and entered the forest. He wanted to worship Lord V\u00e4sudeva to attain his goal. The Lord understood the child's desire and inspired His dear devotee Narada to go and guide him. N\u00e4rada Muni met Dhruva in the forest. He touched the boy's head with his all-virtuous hand and thought to himself, How wonderful are the k\u1e63atriyas who cannot tolerate even a slight infringement upon their prestige. Though he is just a child, he has taken the harsh words of his stepmother so seriously that he left home! Narada then spoke to Dhruva, My dear boy, you are just a child, and you should not be so affected by honor or dishonor. Generally, children are attached to playing. But if you are so developed to understand honor and insult, you should also understand that we receive honor or dishonor due to our karma or past activities. So, an intelligent person is not disappointed by such temporary experiences. N\u00e4rada Muni tested Dhruva's determination. He said, Dear Dhruva, you have come to the forest to worship Lord V\u00e4sudeva, but it is very difficult to satisfy Him. So many great yogis failed to understand and please Him even in many lifetimes. So, please go back home for you will not be successful. Then, when you are grown up, you can attempt to worship the Lord. N\u0101rada Muni didn't mean to discourage Dhruva from worshiping the Lord, but he just tested his determination. Dhruva firmly replied, O great sage, I can't accept your advice. Although your instructions are very good for peace of mind, I am not submissive due to my k\u1e63atriya temperament. Suruci's harsh words have pierced my heart. She didn't allow me to sit on my father's lap or throne Now, I desire the most exalted position in the universe which my forefathers or even Brahm\u0101 has not attained. Please advise an honest path to achieve my goal. N\u0101rada was impressed with the honesty and determination of Dhruva. He wanted to help him in attaining his goal. So he mercifully instructed Dhruva, Dear child, I recommend that you perform bhakti to Lord Vasudeva, as described by your mother. Worshiping Him is the only method to achieve any human goal. Go to Madhuvan on the bank of the Yamuna, where He resides eternally. Take bath three times a day in the Yamuna River. Meditate on Lord Vasudeva with a peaceful mind. N\u0101rada then described the form and qualities of Lord Vasudeva on whom Dhruva was advised to meditate, Lord Vasudeva has a joyful face and glance, a beautiful nose, eyebrows, and forehead. He is always youthful and is more beautiful than all the devat\u0101s. He is most merciful to all His devotees. He is an ocean of mercy. In His four-handed form, He holds a conch, disc, club, and lotus. He wears a jeweled crown, earrings, necklace, bracelets, and the Kaustubha jewel around his neck. He wears yellow silk clothes and shining golden anklets. His lotus-like feet have jewel-like nails glittering, and He stands on the whorl of the lotus of the hearts of those who worship Him in devotion. Therefore, please meditate on Him regularly with great attention. Thus, you will attain great spiritual joy. Along with the process of meditation, Narada Muni also gave a twelve-syllable mantra (dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101k\u1e63ara-mantra) to Dhruva. N\u0101rada mercifully spoke in Dhruva's right ear, om namo bhagavate vasudev\u0101ya - please chant this mantra. Please make a physical form of the Lord with earth and water, and worship Him with this mantra and water, fruits, flowers, vegetables, and other paraphernalia you can easily obtain in the forest. The Lord, like tulas\u012b, leaves very much, so please offer them to Him without fail. Please be peaceful and be satisfied with eating whatever is available in the forest. Also, meditate on the Lord's divine pastimes in His various incarnations. Thus you will attain all blessings of the Lord, and all your desires will be fulfilled. Thus N\u0101rada Muni tested Dhruva's determination and finally gave him good instructions to attain his goal. Dhruva became very grateful to N\u0101rada Muni for his kind guidance. He then circumambulated N\u0101rada, offered obeisances and went to Madhuvan, which is imprinted with the lotus footprints of Krsna.",

        "title": "Success In Six Months",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "After guiding Dhruva on worshiping Lord V\u00e4sudeva, N\u0101rada Muni went to meet King Utt\u0101nap\u0101da. The king welcomed N\u00e4rada respectfully. N\u0101rada asked him, O King, you look morose. Your face is withered. Why are you so sad? King Utt\u0101nap\u0101da replied with regret, O great sage, I am henpecked. I was too attached to my wife Suruci and was merciless towards Sun\u012bti and Dhruva. I have practically banished both of them. My son has now left the palace. He is unprotected in the forest. He might be tired and hungry. Wolves and other wild animals might have attacked him. See my cruelty! Most vile, I did not welcome my son when he tried to climb on my lap. Utt\u0101nap\u0101da was very repentant for his mistake. N\u0101rada Muni consoled Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, Dear King, don't be aggrieved about your son. He is very competent. He is well protected by Lord V\u0101sudeva. Though his greatness is not yet known to this world, he will soon become very famous. His fame will spread throughout the universe. He is going to perform the most difficult task of satisfying the Supreme Lord. He will soon return home. Utt\u0101nap\u0101da felt pacified after hearing Narada Muni's encouraging words. He began treating Sun\u012bti with love and affection and did not show much favoritism towards Suruci. Instead, he eagerly looked forward to the arrival of his son. Meanwhile, at Madhuvan, Dhruva took his bath in River Yamuna and fasted that night. Then he worshipped Lord Krsna as instructed by Narada Muni. Although a child, he performed severe austerities to please the Lord. In the first month, he he sustained himself by eating Kapittha fruits and berries once in three days. In the second month, he ate dry grass and leaves once in six days. In the third month, he just drank water once in nine days. In the fourth month, he just breathed air once in twelve days. Dhruva had controlled his breath and mind by the fifth month and stood motionless on one foot like a pillar. He thus meditated on Lord Vasudeva's beautiful form without distraction. He completely captured the Lord within His mind. By carrying Lord Visnu within his heart with full concentration, Dhruva practically became as heavy as the Lord. As he steadily stood on one leg, the pressure of his toe pushed the earth down. The deratas and residents of all the planets felt suffocated. The three worlds began to tremble. All the devat\u0101s approached Lord Visnu and spoke, Dear Lord, we have never experienced such suffocation. You are the shelter of all living beings. Therefore, we have approached you. Kindly save us from this danger. Lord Visnu reassured the devat\u0101s, Do not be perturbed. This situation in the universe is due to the severe tapasya of Dhruva, who is now fully absorbed in meditation on Me. I shall stop him and save you. Being thus reassured by the Lord, the demigods were relieved of fear and returned to their homes. After that, Lord Visnu went on the back of His bird carrier Garuda to Madhuvan to see His young devotee Dhruva. Dhruva was fully absorbed in meditation and could see the Lord's form within his mind. But suddenly, he lost the vision of the Lord. Being perturbed, he opened his eyes. To his surprise, he saw the Lord personally standing in front of him. When the Lord whom he had seen in his heart appeared before his eyes, Dhruva was overwhelmed. Dhruva offered prostrated obeisances to the Lord by falling like a stick in front of Him. In ecstasy, he seemed to drink the Lord's sweetness with his eyes. He seemed to kiss His lotus feet with his mouth and embrace Him with his arms. Dhruva was spontaneously inspired to offer prayers to the Lord. But he didn't have the necessary knowledge, experience, and vocabulary to praise the Lord. Understanding Dhruva's desire to pray and his inability to do so, the Lord mercifully touched His conch to Dhruva's forehead. By the touch of Visnu's conch, the child became perfectly aware of the conclusions of all the Vedas. Thus, he became equipped with the knowledge of the Lord and the ability to praise Him. Dhruva then offered his heartfelt prayers, O Lord. You are all-powerful. With your spiritual potency, You have awakened my power of speech and made me capable of praising You. You are the creator of the universe and the Supersoul of all living beings. The happiness of devotional service unto You is superior to the happiness of heaven or liberation. Therefore, I desire the association of Your pure-hearted devotees and perform bhakti constantly. I wish to hear Your nectarean pastimes in their company. Thus, I can overcome all miseries of this world. A cow gives milk to an ignorant calf and protects it from wild animals even though the calf does not serve her. Similarly, You mercifully give bhakti to Your devotees even though they worship You with material desires. Dhruva worshiped the Lord with a material ambition to attain a position greater than that of Brahm\u0101. But after performing bhakti for six months and personally seeing the Lord, Dhruva has forgotten all his previous material desires. Now he didn't ask the Lord for what he wanted earlier. He gave up all revengeful feelings towards his stepmother and stepbrother. He just desired to perform bhakti and attain pure love (prema) for the Lord. Satisfied by Dhruva's prayers, the Lord mercifully spoke to Dhruva, O prince, all good fortune unto you. I know your heart's desire. You can rule this earth for 36,000 years after your father's retirement. Your senses will always remain strong. Your brother, Uttama, will die in the future while hunting, and his mother, Suruci, will be burnt in a forest fire while searching for him. After ruling this world, you will remember Me and come to My planet, Dhruvaloka. Dhruvaloka, the polestar, continues to exist even after the universe is destroyed. All the luminaries circumambulate it, and the planets inhabited by the great sages. Having said this, Lord Visnu returned to His abode, on the back of Garuda, as Dhruva looked on. The Lord thus awarded Dhruva the polestar, Dhruvaloka, which is the abode of Lord Visnu within this material world. Upon it, there is a milk ocean, within which is an island called \u015avetadv\u012bpa. Thus, at the time of the destruction of this universe, Dhruvaloka continues to exist, like other Vaikunthas beyond this universe.",
        "quotes": "An honest person admits one's mistakes and repents for them without justifying them., The Lord's kindness fills the hearts of His devotees with satisfaction, joy, and gratitude., When a devotee 'desires' to serve the Lord somehow, the Lord bestows the 'ability to do that service.

But after practicing bhakti, his heart was transformed, and he regretted his former negative feelings. Such honest regret is good and natural for a genuine person. Mistakes are common, but an honest person realizes his mistake, sincerely regrets it, and genuinely tries not to repeat it. So Dhruva didn't hold grudges towards Suruci and Uttama anymore and treated them with love and respect. All this transformation happened in him due to his sincere performance of bhakti.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "Just within six months, Dhruva saw Lord Visnu by his determined practice of bhakti. Although his desires were fulfilled, he was not very pleased. Instead, he felt ashamed, guilty, and regretful, remembering his past material ambitions. He felt unqualified for the association of the Lord in His abode. In deep humility and disgust, Dhruva spoke to himself, Alas, I am so unfortunate and foolish! I could not accept the genuine advice of N\u00e4rada Muni. I desired perishable material things. I maintained a revengeful attitude towards my stepmother. I saw my brother as my enemy. I hankered for material prosperity, name, and fame, but the kind Lord offered me His personal service. I was like a foolish, poor man who asks for only a few grains of broken rice from an emperor. Thus, feeling morose, Dhruva departed from Madhuvan to meet his family. As he was nearing his father's palace, a messenger informed King Uttanapada that Dhruva had returned. The king couldn't believe his good fortune. He remembered N\u00e4rada's words became elated. In great joy, he presented a valuable necklace to the messenger. King Utt\u0101nap\u0101da eagerly came out of the city on a chariot, with his ministers and friends, with the sounding of conches, drums, flutes, and the chanting of Vedic mantras. Sun\u012bti also eagerly came out riding in a palanquin to receive her dearest son. Being a virtuous lady endowed with the best attitude and behavior, Sun\u012bti had Suruci and Uttama ride in her palanquin. Seeing Dhruva from a distance, Utt\u0101nap\u0101da hastily got down from his chariot and, with great affection, embraced the boy. Dhruva is now a great devotee who had been purified by the touch of Lord Visnu. His long-cherished desire fulfilled, the King embraced his son and bathed him with tears. Dhruva respectfully bowed down to the feet of his father and mother. He also touched his head to the feet of Suruci, treating her like his own mother. Having seen the Lord, Dhruva was completely freed from all negative feelings towards Suruci. Seeing Dhruva fall at her feet, Suruci picked him up, embraced him, and with tears in her eyes, she blessed him, May you live long, my child! Although Suruci hated Dhruva earlier and indirectly asked him to die, now she affectionately blessed him to live long. This transformation in Suruci was due to the kindheartedness of Sun\u012bti and the exalted devotional status attained by Dhruva. Uttama and Dhruva embraced each other, overwhelmed by affection, and shed torrents of tears. Now no more bitter feelings in anyone's heart. Sun\u012bti embraced Dhruva, who was dearer to her than her own life. She thus forgot all her grief and was fully satisfied. Sun\u012bti was now the mother of a great hero. Her tears, along with her milk, made Dhruva's body wet. This was auspicious. This represents an abhi\u015feka ceremony performed by his mother, indicating that Dhruva would soon be installed on the throne of his father. People praised Sun\u012bti, By good fortune, your son has come back after being lost for a long time. You must have worshipped the Lord, who saves His devotees from dangers. When everyone was thus praising Dhruva, King Utt\u0101nap\u0101da was delighted. He placed Dhruva and Uttama on an elephant and returned to his city. The city of Uttanap\u0101da was decorated beautifully to receive Dhruva. Every house was draped with mango leaves and strings of pearls and was decorated with water pots and lamps. The city's gates and walls were all decorated with golden ornaments. All the lanes, streets, and watchtowers had been cleansed and sprinkled with sandalwood water. Chaste women offered blessings upon Dhruva as he passed on the road, showering him with flowers. While hearing their pleasing songs, Dhruva entered the palace. Dhruva lived in the palace, being cared for by his affectionate father. The soft bedding in the palace was as white as the foam of milk. The bedsteads were made of ivory with embellishments of gold. The chairs and other furniture were made of gold. Walls were made of marble with many engravings made of valuable jewels, which depicted beautiful women with jewel lamps in their hands. Pleasant gardens were filled with trees with pairs of sweet singing birds and buzzing bumblebees. Lakes with emerald staircases were filled with lotuses, swans, and ducks. As Dhruva grew older, he became very intelligent, mature, and influential among the citizens. Finally, King Utt\u0101nap\u0101da saw the citizens' love for Dhruva, and the ministers' approval, and enthroned Dhruva as emperor of the planet. Utt\u0101nap\u0101da then retired to the forest to fully devote his remaining life for the worship of Lord Visnu. At that time, Dhruva wasn't married.",

        "title": "Consoling The Angry Grandson",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "King Dhruva married Bhrami, the daughter of Prajapati \u0160i\u0161um\u0101ra. They had two sons, namely Kalpa and Vatsara. Dhruva also had a second wife named lla, the daughter of Vayu. She gave birth to a son named Utkala and a beautiful daughter too. Dhruva's brother Uttama once went to the forest for hunting. In the forest, he was killed by a Yaksa. Searching for him, Suruci entered the forest but was burnt in a forest fire. These events were predicted by Lord Visnu earlier. Hearing the news of his brother's death, Dhruva was overwhelmed with anger and lamentation. He took up his bow and arrows to punish the offenders. On a great chariot, he headed northwards to Alak\u0101puri, the city of the Yak\u015fas. Dhruva blew his conch, and the sky echoed with that sound. Hearing it, the wives of the Yaksas became frightened. Unable to tolerate that sound, 130,000 Yaksas came out to attack Dhruva. Dhruva's twanging of his bow created dismay for the Yaksas. He began killing the Yaksas by shooting three arrows at a time. The Yaksas, being shot in their foreheads, anticipated defeat. But still, in a k\u1e63atriya spirit, they praised Dhruva's feat in their minds. Intolerant, like snakes being trampled, the Yaksas shot six arrows each at Dhruva in retaliation. Finally, they attacked him, his chariot, and his charioteer with various types of weapons. Dhruva was covered by the weapons just as torrents of rain covered a mountain. But with rain, all dirt is washed from a mountain, and it shines. Similarly, Dhruva's vigor was renewed by the arrows of Yaksas. Dhruva appeared to merge among the Yaksas, just as the sun sets in the ocean. But although the sun seems to drown in the ocean, the sun is not harmed. Similarly, Dhruva had no difficulty with the Yaksas. As the Yaksas proclaimed victory, Dhruva re-emerged just as the sun appeared from the foggy mist. Unfortunately, insignificant fog cannot cover the sun. Dhruva scattered the Yaksas' weapons with his arrows, just as the wind scatters clouds in the sky. Dhruva's sharp arrows pierced Yaksas' bodies, just as thunderbolts pierce mountains. The battlefield was filled with the limbs and the ornaments of the Yaksas. The injured Yaksas fearfully fled from the battlefield. Seeing no Yaksas on the battlefield, Dhruva desired to see Alak\u0101puri. But thinking that the Yaksas could come back at any time, he did not enter the city. Instead, he expressed his doubts to his charioteer. Suddenly, Dhruva heard sounds as if an ocean were there. Then a dust storm appeared. Within a moment, the sky was overcast with clouds, lightning, and thunder. It rained blood, mucus, pus, stool, urine, and so on. Even human trunks began to fall. Dhruva then saw a mountain in the sky. Hailstones fell from all directions along with swords, clubs, and showers of stones. Deadly snakes, mad elephants, tigers, and lions approached to devour him. All these were the dangerous illusions created by the cruel-natured Yaksas with their demoniac powers. As Dhruva stood there being overpowered by the illusory tricks of the Yaksas, some great sages arrived there to encourage him. They prayed for Dhruva's protection, May Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana kill your enemies. Simply by chanting or hearing His holy name, one can easily be protected from death. By offering this prayer, the sages reminded Dhruva about the n\u0101r\u0101ya\u0146\u0101stra or the weapon of Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana, which is capable of destroying all illusions. Hearing the encouraging words of the sages, Dhruva fixed the n\u0101r\u0101ya\u0146\u0101stra on his bow. Then the illusions immediately vanished. The n\u0101r\u0101ya\u0146\u0101stra fired arrows with shafts of gold and feathers of swans, that started destroying the Yaksas. The Yaksas were agitated and angrily rushed at Dhruva with raised weapons. Dhruva then cut off the limbs of the Yaksas with his arrows. Finally, in excessive anger, he started killing so many Yaksas, almost destroying their entire race. Seeing many innocent Yaksas being killed, Dhruva's grandfather Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu appeared there along with many sages. He affectionately spoke to Dhruva, Enough dear grandson, excessive anger is sinful. It has been proven that you are affectionate to your brother and aggrieved about his death. But for the fault of one Yak\u015fa, you have killed unnecessarily many offenceless Yaksas. This act is not befitting our dynasty and cannot be appreciated by the virtuous. Manu continued, Dear Dhruva, you are so fortunate that you are already destined to achieve Vaikuntha. I am surprised by your act because you are a great devotee and are recognized by other devotees like N\u0101rada. You are supposed to be an example for others to follow. By being tolerant and merciful to all beings, one can please the Supreme Lord and achieve His abode. The Yaksas are not the killers of your brother because nothing happens unless the Supreme Lord sanctions it. So please give up anger and take shelter from the Lord. By killing so many Yaksas, you disrespected Kuvera, who is their leader. Therefore, you must immediately pacify Kuvera with your prayers. The wrath of great people will affect our family. After thus instructing Dhruva, Manu returned to his abode. Dhruva humbly followed the instructions of Manu and restrained them from fighting. Learning that Dhruva's anger had subsided, Kuvera appeared there. Kuvera spoke, O sinless one, I am very pleased to know that you have given up your enmity, which is very difficult to avoid. Actually, you have not killed the Yaksas, nor did they kill your brother. The Supreme Lord sanctioned all these events. He is the supreme controller and the cause of all causes. So, please worship Him. Please ask a boon without hesitation. We have heard that you are constantly engaged in the loving service of Lord Vasudeva. Dhruva then asked Kuvera, My, I have unflinching faith in and remembrance of Lord Krsna. Although Kuvera was the treasurer of the devat\u0101s and could have offered immense riches to Dhruva, Dhruva did not ask him for temporary material wealth. He just desired constant remembrance of the Lord's lotus feet. Dhruva was apprehensive that Kuvera's displeasure might act as an obstacle for his remembrance of Krsna. However, Kuvera gladly offered the boon, and Dhruva returned back to his kingdom.",
        "quotes": "One shouldn't underestimate a powerful enemy., The body of every living being is a residence (or a temple) of the Lord.

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON ANGER: With great power comes great responsibility to utilize it properly. Emotion and discrimination sometimes compete with each other. We shouldn't be carried away by temporary emotions and lose discrimination. Sometimes we give in to negative emotions like anger. Anger, when unchecked, keeps increasing uncontrollably. Thus, one harms others and oneself too. In such situations, well-wishers help us by giving good counsel. We should be open to their good advice to save ourselves from the harmful effects of excessive anger.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "Emperor Dhruva ruled his kingdom with full responsibility. He worshipped the Supreme Lord Vi\u015fnu by great sacrifices and profuse charities. As a king, Dhruva was endowed with all godly qualities, respectful to the br\u0101hma\u0146as, kind to the poor, protected dharma, and treated his citizens as his own children. Dhruva thus ruled the earth for 36,000 years as foretold by Lord Visnu. He then handed over the kingdom to his son and retired to Badarik\u0101\u015brama. There he meditated on the Lord and entered into trance (sam\u0101dhi). By his constant bhakti, he experienced continuous bliss. One day, Dhruva saw a beautiful airplane coming down from the sky, illuminating all directions like a full moon. In that plane, he saw two chief associates of Lord Visnu - blackish, youthful, four-armed, with reddish lotus eyes, holding clubs, dressed attractively, wearing helmets, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. Seeing them, Dhruva stood up, but he forgot how to receive them properly, being astonished. He simply offered respect by folding his hands and chanting the holy names. He bowed down humbly, absorbed in thinking of Krsna's lotus feet. Those two divine personalities Nanda and Sunanda, spoke to Dhruva, Dear Dhruva, let there be good fortune unto you. When you were five years old, you pleased the Lord with your worship. We are associates of Lord Visnu, the creator of all universes. Therefore, we have come to take you to His abode. Please come and reside in Vi\u015fnu-loka, which is very rare to achieve. That highest planet is circumambulated by all planets and luminaries and is worshipable by the inhabitants of all other planets. Therefore, you are worthy to board this unique airplane sent by the Lord. Hearing these sweet words, Dhruva accepted blessings from the sages, worshipped and circumambulated the airplane, and offered his respects to Nanda and Sunanda. Then, he became as effulgent as gold and prepared to board the airplane. Drums resounded in the sky, Gandharvas sang, and devat\u0101s showered flowers. As the plane was ascending, Dhruva remembered his mother, who first instructed him in the worship of Lord Visnu. He thought, How can I go to Vaikuntha, leaving behind my poor mother? Dhruva was about to jump off the airplane. Understanding his mind, Nanda and Sunanda showed him another airplane in which Sun\u012bti was also going to Vaikuntha. Dhruva saw many planets on his way to Dhruvaloka. Thus passing through the Bhur, Bhuvar, and Svarlokas, the airplane finally arrived at Dhruvaloka, the residence of Lord Visnu, beyond the planets of the seven sages. Thus Dhruva, who was fully Krsna conscious, attained the crest jewel of the three worlds. The entire zodiac belt circumambulates Dhruvaloka with great speed. Great devotees very much like to hear about Dhruva. By hearing the story of Dhruva, one attains great wealth, fame, longevity, heaven, Dhruvaloka, pure bhakti, good qualities, power, and respect. All sins and miseries will be diminished. Both the reciter and audience will become perfect.",
        "quotes": "What was possible for Dhruva is possible for everyone by proper training in Krishna consciousness from childhood.,  As Lord Vishnu is worshipable, so are His associates, paraphernalia, airplane, and abode., Taking inspiration from Suniti, every mother can train her child to become a devotee of the Supreme Lord., Vaikuntha is easily reached by those who are merciful, peaceful, equipoised, pure, able to please everyone and keeping friendships only with the Lord's devotees.",

Our parents, teachers, and many others help up in different ways in different capacities, directly or indirectly. We must remember their significant contributions to our progressive lives, be grateful to them, and try to serve them to the best of our abilities. Although one cannot completely repay the debt one owes to many great souls, a grateful person humbly attempts to do some service. Such grateful service nourishes our souls and pleases God.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "In the glorious dynasty of Dhruva, there was a great king named Anga. Out of his good character, he always protected his citizens like a loving father. He was always respectful to the elders and br\u0101hmanas. His queen Sunitha was the daughter of Mrtyu, death personified. Once King Anga performed a yaj\u00f1a (fire sacrifice) where expert priests chanted mantras to invite the devat\u0101s to accept offerings. Although the priests properly chanted the hymns using pure paraphernalia, the devat\u0101s didn't arrive. Anga was surprised and confused. DID YOU KNOW? WHAT IS A YAJNA? Yaj\u00f1a genera fire sacrifice, but it is intereat. Yaj\u00f1a is any activity pada pure intent, to please ke His blessings. Traditionally, fire sacrifice involves making various offerings to Lord Vi\u015fnu and the devat\u0101s, whose pleasure brings peace and prosperity to the people and piety to the performer. Devotees do not appreciate sacrifices conducted for material benefits. Anga asked the sages, O br\u0101hma\u0146as, kindly tell me if I have committed any offenses because of which the dev\u0101tas are not accepting my offerings. The head priests replied, O King, you have been sinless in this life. But due to some sin in your previous life, you do not have a son now. That is why the devatas are not accepting your oblations. If you desire a son, you may conduct a sacrifice to please Lord Visnu. He fulfills the desires of one who worships Him sincerely. When you invite Visnu in your sacrifice, then the devatas will follow and accept your offerings. After that, the priests conducted a great sacrifice to enable King Anga to get a son. When they offered oblations to Lord Visnu, an effulgent person appeared from the sacrificial fire, carrying a golden pot of p\u0101yasam. King Anga accepted the p\u0101yasam, and with the permission of the priests, he offered it to his wife, Sun\u012bth\u0101. She drank it and became pregnant.In due course of time, Sun\u012bth\u0101 gave birth to a son named Vena. Unfortunately, the boy grew up to be very cruel. He attained the qualities of his maternal grandfather, Mrtyu. Even as a child, he would kill his playmates mercilessly. He would unnecessarily kill innocent animals. All the citizens were frightened by his mere presence. King Anga became worried about his son Vena and tried to reform him by punishing him several times. However, Anga failed in his attempts and thus became greatly aggrieved. Disgusted with his son's character, Anga thought, Being sonless is better than having such a cruel son. A sinful son destroys one's reputation and causes endless anxiety. Anga then saw his situation from a different perspective and concluded, In fact, having a bad son is also beneficial. Because a bad son makes one realize the miserable nature of this world and helps one develop detachment. Also, ultimately one has to focus on one's eternal relationship with God. With these thoughts, King Anga decided to leave home. He entered the forest in the dead of night, giving up all attraction for kingdom and opulence. Instead, he dedicated his life to meditation and service of the Lord without any deviation and finally reached God's abode. What do you think happened next? Did cruel Vena take over, or was the kingdom rendered kingless? Read on to find out!",

        "trivia": "What is a YAJNA? Yaj\u00f1a generally means a fire sacrifice, but it is not limited to that. Yaj\u00f1a is any activity performed with a pure intent, to please God and invoke His blessings. Traditionally, fire sacrifice involves making various offerings to Lord Visnu and the devtas, whose pleasure brings peace and prosperity to the people and peity to the performer.

        "lesson": "A Lessson On Perspective: Imagine looking around through a pair of blue glasses. Won't everything appear to be blue? That vision is called perspective. For example, we saw how king Anga earlier felt that having a bad son was a misfortune but later considered it a fortune. This is due to his change of perspective. We can see the same situation - positively or negatively, materially or spiritually. Life becomes a refreshing journey simply by molding our perspective. To respond to various situations effectively, we need to equip ourselves with a mature perspective. It is possible by associating with the wise, reading wisdom texts, and worshiping God. The power to turn a situation into a blessing or a curse now rests in your hands!",

        "title": "The Cruel Comes to Power",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "The news of King Anga's sudden departure spread throughout the kingdom. The citizens, priests, and ministers became greatly aggrieved. They searched for Anga everywhere, but no one could find him. Disappointed, they all returned to the city and informed the assembled sages. The sages, headed by Bhrgu Muni, were always concerned about the welfare of people in general. However, they could see that without a king, people would be unregulated and stoop to the level of animals. Thus, they decided to make Anga's son Vena the King. Although the ministers disagreed, the sages took permission from Queen Sun\u012bth\u0101 and coronated Vena as the King. Vena's cruelty was well-known all over the kingdom. When the thieves heard that Vena became the King, they became afraid and hid. Naturally, Vena was ruthless, and he became even more arrogant on ascending to the throne. He considered himself the greatest and started insulting exalted personalities. Being blind and intoxicated with power and position, The traveled everywhere, causing the Earth and sky to tremble. He prohibited the br\u0101hma\u0146as from performing sacrifices and forbade all spiritual activities in the kingdom. Seeing Vena's atrocities, the sages became concerned about the citizens' welfare. Being compassionate at heart, they discussed, Fearing a political crisis in the absence of a king, we crowned Vena as the King. Naturally, he is cruel, and by becoming the king, he turned out to be an enemy of the citizens. The people are in danger from both sides due to an irresponsible king and the thieves. It is like a log with fire blazing at both ends. We should try to counsel Vena. If he does not accept our advice, we shall burn that sinner to ashes with our powers. Supporting this wicked King is like maintaining a poisonous snake with milk. Having thus decided, the sages approached Vena. Concealing their anger, they tried to pacify him with sweet words. They said, Dear King, please hear us attentively, for our good advice will surely benefit you. By acting according to dharma, you will be freed from all miseries and attain liberation. By obstructing the worship of Lord Visnu and the devatas, you will spoil the spiritual lives of your citizens and will surely fall from your position. A pious king is supposed to protect the citizens from enemies and facilitate the worship of Lord Visnu. When the Lord and the devat\u0101s are satisfied, you will attain all success and prosperity. Although the sages spoke appropriate words with good intentions, Verna replied very arrogantly, I am the King and the real God and master of all the citizens. Since you all are unchaste, you desire to worship Visnu and the devat\u0101s instead of me. You can't be happy in this life or the next. The King is the reservoir of all the devat\u0101s. Vi\u015fnu, Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and all the devat\u0101s reside in king's body. So, you better worship me with all your offerings and sacrifices. Only I can enjoy all the sacrificial offerings. In this way, Vena foolishly spoke some false philosophy considering himself God and disregarded Lord Visnu. Being so sinful, he deviated from the right path. He thought himself very learned and insulted the merciful sages who had made him king. Hearing Vena's disrespectful words and considering his sinful mentality, the sages became enraged and shouted, Kill him! Kill him! He is the most heinous and impudent person who disregards Lord Visnu. If he lives, he will turn the whole world to ashes. Therefore, he does not deserve to sit on the throne. Then the sages killed shameless Vena simply by their angry words, without any weapons. After the sages left, Vena's mother, Sun\u012bth\u0101, being aggrieved, preserved Vena's dead body with special ingredients and mantras. But what happened to the kingless state? After so much chaos, there isn't any answer to the search for a suitable king. Will thieves rule the general public? Will the sages help in some way, or will they neglect the situation?

Although kindhearted, they may chastise the wrongdoers to protect the innocent. Exactly what a loving mother would do out of concern!

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "The sages killed cruel Vena for the benefit of the citizens. However, after Vena's death, thieves in the kingdom flourished. They took advantage of a kingless state and tormented innocent people who thus suffered greatly. One day, the sages assembled at the banks of River Sarasvat\u012b to discuss spiritual subjects. Considering the country's worsening situation, they thought to themselves, Although we br\u0101hma\u0146as are supposed to be peaceful and equipoised, we shouldn't be neglectful to people in general. Such neglect will diminish our spiritual power just as the water kept in a cracked pot leaks out. Although the powerful sages could subdue the thieves, they considered it improper. They felt that the solution to the problem is not just punishing the thieves but appointing an able king who punishes them and protects the people. Thus, the sages desired to restore the pure dynasty of King Anga, who was a descendant of bruva. Although vena was born in such a glorious dynasty, he turned wicked by acquiring the qualities of his maternal grandfather Mrtyu, death personified. Therefore, the sages decided to produce another body from the carefully preserved dead body of Vena by using their powers. The sages then approached Vena's mother, Sun\u012bth\u0101, and brought out the dead body of Vena. They churned the thighs of Vena's body in a specific method, and from that a devilish dwarf-like person appeared. He was blackish and short with large jaws, a flat nose, reddish eyes, and copper-colored hair. His name was B\u0101huka, a product of the impure portion of Vena's body. Taking over the terrible sins of Vena on being born, B\u0101huka later fathered an uncivilized tribal race called the Nais\u0101das. His descendants always reside in hills and forests, engaging in sinful activities. Vena's body was produced from both Anga and Sun\u012bth\u0101. The sages separated the impure portion of Vena's body resulting from Sun\u012bth\u0101 in the form of degraded Bahuka. The pure portion of Vena's body, resulting from saintly Anga, would give birth to a noble king. The sages then churned the two arms of Vena's body from which a celestial male and female appeared. The sages were pleased and said, This divine couple have appeared as incarnations of Lak\u1e63m\u012b and N\u00e4r\u0101yana. The effulgent man is Prthu, an expansion of Lord Visnu. He will be the foremost among kings because he has the power to maintain the whole world. That beautiful queen's name is Arci, an expansion of Goddess Laksmi. The brahma\u0146as praised King Prthu, the Gandharvas sang His glories, the Siddhas showered flowers, and the Apsaras danced in ecstasy. Conches, bugles, drums, and kettledrums were played joyfully in the  outer space. Lord Brahm\u0101 also arrived there along with the devat\u0101s. Seeing the special and auspicious marks on the body of King Prthu, Brahm\u0101 concluded that Prthu was an incarnation of the Lord. The brahma\u0146as then arranged for King Prthu's coronation as the King. People collected different paraphernalia for the ceremony. King Prthu was exquisitely dressed and sat on the throne with his well-ornamented wife, Arci. They appeared as bright as rare golden pearls. Various personalities generously offered precious gifts to King Prthu. Kuvera, the treasurer of the devat\u0101s, presented a gleaming royal throne made of pure gold. Varuna, the God of oceans, offered a gigantic umbrella as effulgent as the moon. Vayu, the wind-god gif two enormous camara fans. Indra, the King of heaven, prese a magnificent crown. Yama, the Lord of death, presented a sters punishing rod to discipline the miscreants. Brahm\u00e4 gave him an armor Sarasvati offered a divine necklace studded with gemstones. Lond Hari gifted a potent Sudar\u015bana cakra. Laksmi bestowed imperishab opulence. Lord \u015aiva presented an exquisite sword marked with ten moons. Durga gifted a shield marked with hundred moons. Soma the moon god, gave powerful horses. Vi\u015bvakarma offered a beautiful chariot. Agni, the fire god, gave a special bow. S\u00fcrya, the sun god, offered him arrows as brilliant as sunshine. Bh\u016bmi presented magical flying shoes. The sages offered profuse blessings. All the devatas constantly showered fragrant flowers. Professional singers and bards offered prayers and praises to King Prthu. Prthu smiled and spoke, You are praising me extraordinarily for having many good qualities. But I haven't yet portrayed these qualities. If I don't display these qualities in the future, your words will be as good as a lie. So, it is better to praise someone who has already displayed these good qualities. In such great assemblies, the Supreme Lord Vi\u015fnu must be glorified, not a low human like me. The bards were very pleased with the humility of King Prthu. They continued to praise his qualities of compassion, courage, righteousness ability to protect citizens, truthfulness, respect, detachment, devotion, etc. Humble Prthu then offered gifts to the bards, who then departed happily. Prthu then began ruling the kingdom. How did Prthu restore the prosperity of the kingdom? Was everything peaceful and harmonious forever? Read on to know!",
        "quotes": "We need to understand and address the root cause of the problem instead of just dealing with the symptoms of the problem., An incarnation of God has some striking features; His advent is mentioned in the scriptures. Therefore, one shouldn't blindly accept anyone as an incarnation., Offering gifts is an expression of love and respect that sweetens relationships., Unless a king is endowed with good character, he cannot effectively rule and protect his citizens.",
        "activity": "1. What gifts gave you the greatest happiness so far? Who gave it to you? What gift would you like to offer that person(s) in return? 2. Isn't it difficult to refuse praise? Share your thoughts. 3. Go and praise someone in your family who you find humble. Note their response. 4. Recall two incidents where you humbly denied praise despite doing something good and accepted praise without doing much.",
        "lesson": "A Lesson On Humility: Don't you like being praised? Enjoying praise is easy, but refusing is difficult, isn't it? We feel encouraged when someone appreciates us, yet it's possible that we can become proud of undue praise. The weapon that helps us counteract the ill effects of pride is humility. Despite being qualified, a humble person denies praise. Accepting glorification without any qualification is inappropriate. While proud leaders like Vena demand respect like Prthu deny respect despite being qualified. Humble people know that all they have attained is due to the mercy of the Lord. So they are not falsely proud of their achievements but acknowledge the grace of God and remain His humble servants.",

        "story": "One day the citizens of King Prthu approached him with sad faces and said, Dear King, we are starving and suffering from great hunger due to insufficient food grains. Please help us! King Prthu thought on their complaint for a long time and finally came to the conclusion that mother Earth was not providing sufficient food grains. Annoyed with this, King Prthu took up his bow and aimed an arrow at the goddess of Earth. Trembling with fear, she took the form of a cow and ran away like a deer pursued by a hunter. Powerful Prthu started chasing the cow-shaped Earth wherever she fled, even in outer space. Finally, the Earth turned to Prthu in helplessness and said, O King, being the knower of dharma, you are meant to offer shelter and protection to all living beings. I have not committed any offenses. How can a merciful person like you attempt to kill a sinless woman like me? King Prthu said, O Earth, you claim to be sinless, but your mistake is that you have not produced sufficient food grains for my citizens. Therefore, punishing such an offender is appropriate. You have hidden all the seeds of plants within you. A king is supposed to kill such a merciless person. The Earth could understand that Prthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was an empowered incarnation of Lord Visnu. She spoke with folded hands to pacify him, Please control your anger and hear me patiently. Yes, I had hidden the seeds and grains, because materialistic people use all my seeds, herbs, and grains for their selfish purposes. The King before you (Vena) didn't properly protect me. He disrespected me by stopping all the sacrifices and spreading adharma everywhere. After his death, the kingdom was filled with thieves. Therefore, I withheld all the resources within me so that I can provide them back when righteous kings like you start ruling. The Earth continued, Now because a righteous person like you has become the king, I am ready to provide all the grains, seeds, and all other natural resources for your kingdom. After hearing the words of the Earth, King Prthu became very pleased. As promised, the Earth generously provided all her resources to everyone. Therefore, King Prthu was very satisfied with the Earth and developed a fatherly affection towards her. After this, Prthu flattened the Earth by breaking up the hills with his bow. He created suitable houses for them and founded many villages, towns, cities, forts, mines, etc. Earlier people lived in an unorganized manner, but Prthu made town and city planning in an organized way. Prthu was as like a good father to all the citizens. He conducted many sacrifices for their welfare and prosperity. But the nature of this world is that although one tries to do good to everyone, some envious people try to create problems. What problem did Prthu encounter? Read the next chapter to know.",
        "quotes": "A good leader must be a good listener and thinker. Only then can he address problems effectively., Children, women, cows, brahmanas, and old people should always be protected.

        "lesson": "A Lesson On Harmony: The planet Earth is the mother of all living beings. She happily provides food, shelter, and all-natural resources needed by all life forms. Isn't it our duty to take care of such a loving mother? What is painful to her is when human beings take to sinful attitudes and activities. Instead of exploiting the resources of Earth and distributing other living beings, we need to live in harmony with her, and utilize her resources for our sustenance and service to the Lord. If we do so, Mother Earth will give us all prosperity. It is completely up to her to make available or withhold her resources, depending on how pure or sinful we are. All in all, let us pledge to live in harmony with mother Earth today!",

        "title": "One Short of A Century!",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "Once, King Prthu intended to perform one hundred sacrifices at a place called Brahm\u0101varta, where the holy River Sarasvati flowed. Lord Vi\u015fnu, Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, the devat\u0101s, and many sages were present in those sacrifices. Prthu thus successfully completed ninety-nine sacrifices and was about to begin hundredth one. Indra, the King of heaven, could not tolerate Prthu's success. Indra was called \u015bata-kratu because he had performed a hundred sacrifices to attain his post. Seeing Prthu breaking his record now, Indra became very envious. He felt insecure that Prthu would outdo him. So, he planned to impede Prthu's sacrifice, although he was aware that a sacrifice is the worship of Lord Visnu, and should not be disrupted. When Prthu was performing the hundredth sacrifice, Indra appeared there dressed up like a noble s\u0101dhu. He cunningly stole the sacrificial horse which was an essential part of the sacrifice. Sage Atri noticed this and hurriedly informed Prthu's son to catch and the thief. Indra fled with the horse through the sky in great haste. Seeing Indra in the dress of a sanny\u0101s\u012b, with matted locks and a body smeared in ashes, Prthu's son did not release his arrows. But Atri Muni encouraged Prthu's son to kill Indra. Indra then gave up his fake dress and the horse and disappeared from that spot. Prthu's son then brought the horseback to the sacrificial arena. Seeing this great act, the sages named him Vijit\u0101\u015bva, he who has won the horse. Indra again came in the form of another sanny\u0101si. Using his mystical powers, he created dense darkness in the sacrificial arena and again shamelessly stole the horse. Vijit\u0101\u015bva chased Indra again, but seeing Indra in the dress of a sanny\u0101s\u012b, carrying a staff with a skull on top, Vijit\u0101\u015bva did not kill him. Again, ordered by Atri, Vijit\u0101\u015bva angrily aimed an arrow to kill Indra. Indra gave up that horse and his false dress upon seeing this and became invisible. Vijit\u0101\u015bva brought back the horse once again. Whatever different forms Indra accepted for stealing the horse misguided common people. Some foolish people who saw this started adopting the dresses of sanny\u0101s\u012bs like Indra. They thought that the sanny\u0101sa dress was an excellent way to escape punishment for theft or other such crimes. Thus, Indra irresponsibly misled the people. Seeing Indra repeatedly disrupting his sacrifice, Prthu angrily took up his bow to kill Indra. The priests then requested Prthu, O great soul, please don't kill Indra. We will offer him into the sacrificial fire by the power of our mantras. Then the priests prepared to offer oblations into the fire to kill Indra. At that moment, Lord Brahm\u0101 appeared there and forbade them to do so. Lord priests, Brahm\u0101 told You should the not kill stubborn Indra. He has already disrupted dharma by attempting to hinder the sacrifice. If you oppose him more, he will further misuse his power and introduce many other false religious systems. Brahma then turned to Prthu and said, Being a sensible king, it is better that you stop your hundredth sacrifice to prevent the spread of adharma by Indra. Instead of stopping stubborn Indra, who wouldn't listen to good advice, elderly Brahm\u0101 suggested Prthu stop the sacrifice. Because Prthu was more mature, responsible, flexible, and submissive, he immediately stopped his hundredth sacrifice. He understood Brahm\u0101's concern for people in general. By Brahm\u0101's blessings, Prthu's fame exceeded that of Indra, although he performed only ninety-nine sacrifices. Also, we see that Brahm\u0101 desired a transformation in Indra and not his death. After that, Lord Visnu appeared in the sacrificial arena, along with Indra. Prthu became very happy to see his beloved Lord. The Lord said, My dear Prthu, I am very pleased with you. Here is Indra, who has come here seeking forgiveness from you. Please forgive him. Ashamed of his sin, Indra fell at Prthu's feet with a regretful heart. Prthu embraced Indra and wholeheartedly forgave him. Lord Visnu was satisfied with Prthu. Seeing the Lord's graceful form, Prthu's eyes were filled with tears and his voice choked up in ecstasy. The Lord could not depart, being captivated by Prthu's devotion. His feet generally do not touch the Earth. But out of affection for Prthu, He touched the Earth and placed His hand on Garuda as if to prevent Himself from losing his balance. Wiping his tears, Prthu offered his prayers, O Lord, You are the best giver of boons. But I don't ask You for heaven or liberation. Instead, please give me a million ears to hear Your wonderful pastimes from Your devotees. I only desire to serve You like Mother Lak\u1e63m\u012b. I don't exactly know what to ask for. Therefore, please give me whatever You think is best for me, just like a father acts for the benefit of his child. Then Lord Visnu told Prthu, May you have bhakti unto Me for nothing is more beneficial than that. Having thus blessed Prthu, the Lord departed. All in all, Prthu scored 99, while Indra scored 100. Prthu's flexibility submissiveness, detachment, responsibility, forgiveness, and the blessings he received from Brahma and Lord Visnu - all together are hundreds of times greater than a hundred sacrifices. On another occasion, Prthu conducted another sacrifice attended by great sages and devat\u0101s. In that great assembly, Prthu spoke about God's unlimited mercy and how we should perform bhakti to please Him. In this manner, King Prthu thus ruled his kingdom in an exemplary manner. Although he was amidst great opulence and comforts, he was fixed up in his bhakti. As a result, his reputation was widespread throughout the universe. Eventually, Prthu handed over the kingdom to his sons and retired to the forest to worship the Supreme Lord Krsna. With his uninterrupted and determined efforts he finally reached the spiritual world. What happened to King Prthu's kingdom after he left? Did it perish!? Flip forward to find out!",
        "quotes": "Unwanted qualities like envy and pride exist even in devatas, who thus sometimes commit sins knowingly., A stubborn person doesn't restrain from committing a mistake despite repeated failures. On the contrary, if such determination is employed in good activities, one is benefitted a lot., Leaders must behave responsibly, knowing that their activities impact innocent people., A mature leader tries to resolve conflicts without rejecting the wrongdoer but reforming him. Hate the sin, not the sinner., Forgiveness is a quality of those who are advanced in spiritual wisdom., One's glory depends not on the size of one's accomplishments but on the quality of one's character.",
        "activity": "1. Sacrifice is a means of worshiping Lord Vishnu. Indra performed 100 sacrifices, and Prthu performed only 99. So who do you think won the heart of Vishnu, and why? 2. How does this story inspire you to appreciate other's success and not envy them? 3. Enlist two ways how you can increase your flexibility.",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON FLEXIBILITY: In this story, King Prthu was flexible and prioritized higher principles and the welfare of people over a completing hundred sacrifices. But King Indra was too rigid in fulfilling his selfish purposes, despite repeated failures and harm to others. Flexible people win more trust from their seniors than those who are stubborn. Although sometimes they are seen as weak for giving up their ambitions, it is they who are truly strong. Defeat lies in being rigid to serve one's selfish purpose, while victory lies in compromising for a higher purpose!, A LESSON ON COMPETITION: Do you enjoy competing with your friends? Or do you just feel it is necessary to prove yourself or outsmart someone? A healthy competitive spirit that results in improving our performance is good. But an unhealthy competition inspired by envy is harmful to oneself and others. P\u00e5thu never intended to compete with Indra, but Indra felt insecure seeing Prthu's success. One shouldn't unnecessarily compete with others in a spirit of passion and intolerance towards their success. An insecure person like Indra cannot digest others' success and causes impediments in their efforts. On the contrary, one who has good character inspires, encourages, and helps others attain success and wholeheartedly appreciates their success.",

        "story": "After Prthu's retirement, his eldest son Vijit\u0101\u015bva became the King. He gave his younger brothers different parts of the kingdom out of love. Vijit\u0101\u015bva considered his kingly duties, like collecting taxes and punishing people, very painful. So, he gave up his kingly position on the pretext of performing a long sacrifice. He thus worshipped the Supreme Lord Visnu in His form called Hams\u00e4vatara (the Swan incarnation) and attained the Lord's abode. Vijit\u0101\u015bva's son named Havirdh\u0101na then became the King. He had six sons. The eldest son was Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi, an expert in performing sacrifices and yoga. He was very much attached to conducting several sacrifices and so covered the entire earth with ku\u015ba grass. On the order of Brahm\u0101, Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi married \u015aatadruti, the beautiful daughter of the ocean god. They gave birth to ten virtuous sons together called the Pracet\u0101s. Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi ordered his sons to enter married life, beget children and rule the kingdom. As a preparation to take up the serious responsibilities as husbands, fathers, and rulers, he had sent them to the forest to perform devotional austerities to please Lord Vasudeva (Krsna). Accepting their father's instructions submissively, the Pracetas travelling towards the west, reached a dense forest, where they saw a huge, beautiful lake with blooming lotuses. The atmosphere around the lake was so festive with the chirping of sweet-sounding birds, accompanied by gentle cool breezes. There were also trees, creepers and humming bees. The Pracet\u0101s also heard attractive celestial songs and became amazed. To their surprise, the Pracet\u0101s saw magnificent Lord \u015aiva emerging from that lake along with his wonderful associates. The ten princes immediately offered obeisances to Lord \u015aiva out of great respect. Lord \u015aiva then mercifully blessed the Pracet\u0101s and said, O princes, let there be good fortune unto you. I am very pleased with your excellent etiquette and knowledge. I am granting you special mercy for you to worship Lord V\u0101sudeva. Anyone who worships V\u0101sudeva with devotion is very dear to me. I love devotees like you as much as I love the Lord Himself. The devotees also consider me as dear to them as the Lord Himself. Let me teach you an auspicious and divine prayer called the Rudra-g\u012bta. By chanting this song, you will receive the mercy of Lord Vasudeva. With a joyful heart, Lord \u015aiva then sang the Rudra-g\u012bta. The Pracetas heard him very attentively with folded hands. In the beautiful Rudra-g\u012bta, there were prayers offered to various divine forms of Lord Krsna. Rudra-g\u012bta include praises of the Lord's powers, expressions of pure devotion, and requests for protection. It also describes the most enchanting form of Lord Krsna, who is the collection of all beauties. Lord \u015aiva declared that the most favorable method for everyone to easily attain the kingdom of God is the all-auspicious path of bhakti unto Lord Krsna. Having thus taught the Rudra-gita to the Pracet\u0101s, Lord Siva instructed them, Please chant this Rudra-gita prayer wholeheartedly regularly. Meditate on Lord Visnu and worship Him with devotion. Lord Brahm\u0101 had said that this prayer destroys ignorance and enables one to become a devotee of the Lord quickly. Hearing Rudra-gita early in the morning and letting others hear it frees one from all miseries Recite these prayers, and thus you will surely attain Lord Visnu's mercy. Lord Siva then departed. The Pracet\u0101s submissively and sincerely followed the instructions of their guru, Lord \u015aiva. Exhibiting complete dedication, they entered the sea and meditated on Lord Visnu while chanting the Rudra-g\u012bta for ten thousand long years in the water. Thus, they eventually attained the dar\u015bana of Lord Visnu, who offered them profuse blessings and benedictions. Hold on... are we missing someone? Yes! Pr\u0101c\u012bnibarhi, the father of the Pracet\u0101s. Was he worried that his sons hadn't returned? What was he doing in the absence of his sons? Read on to find out!",
        "quotes": "Austerity means to accept some inconvenience upon oneself for a higher purpose voluntarily. Austerities ensure the holistic development of one's personality with internal maturity and external tolerance., A compassionate devotee guides new devotees in bhakti even without being asked., A sincere recipient of true knowledge passes it on to others without any adulteration., By sincerely following the guru's instructions with dedication, one can attain the mercy of the Lord.",
        "trivia": "DID YOU KNOW? WHOM DOES LORD SIVA FAVOR? Lord Siva is sometimes seen giving boons to materialistic people or demons like R\u00e4va\u0146a, B\u0101\u0146\u0101sura, Vrk\u0101sura, and so on. But \u015aiva is not impressed with them, nor does he intend to favor them. So how can a demoniac person please a noble personality like \u015aiva? \u015aiva offers boons to demons only as a formality in response to their austerities. However, those boons ultimately lead to the destruction of the demons in the hands of Vi\u015f\u0146u, Krsna, or Rama. Thus, the benedictions of Lord Siva generally end up glorifying Lord Vi\u015fnu as the ultimate protector. \u015aiva, therefore, takes pleasure in praising his beloved Lord Vi\u015f\u0146u. One who worships Lord Vi\u015fnu or Krsna is called a Vaisnava. \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavatam says that Lord \u015aiva is the foremost among all the Vaisnavas (vai\u015f\u0146av\u0101n\u0101m yath\u0101 \u015bambhu). Thus, \u015aiva is very favorable to all the devotees of Lord Vis\u0146u and voluntarily guides them in vi\u015fnu-bhakti, just as he did in the case of the Pracet\u0101s.",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON SINCERITY: A genuine teacher desires the success of the students. Isn't it? Reciprocally, a sincere student is submissive to such a teacher's instructions and grateful for the guidance received. Good students show submissiveness in front of the teacher and follow the teacher's advice even in their absence. Such qualities in teachers and students are crucial in spiritual life. The secret of success in spiritual life is in sincerely following the instructions of a guru and thus attaining the Lord's mercy. This is what has happened in the life of the Pracetas.",

        "story": "While the Pracet\u00e3s were in the forest worshiping the Lord, their father, Pr\u0101c\u012bnibarhi, was engrossed in performing various fire sacrifices. Unfortunately, in those sacrifices, many animals were being killed. The great sage Narada became compassionate on the animals and the ignorant King as well. He felt that a descendant of Dhruva's glorious dynasty shouldn't be involved in such material activities. So he decided to meet Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi and educate him. N\u0101rada Muni went to Pr\u0101c\u012bnibarhi and asked, What do you desire to achieve by these sacrifices? You can't attain enduring happiness or avoid miseries by these sacrifices! Pr\u0101c\u012bnibarhi was shaken and said submissively, O great sage, my intelligence is very poor. Please enlighten me with the right knowledge. N\u0101rada Muni then created a mystic vision in the sky for Pr\u0101c\u012bnibarhi and said, O King, please see those animals you have mercilessly sacrificed. They all are awaiting your death, to pierce your body with deadly iron horns. Pr\u0101c\u012bnibarhi was surprised. N\u0101rada Muni then narrated a symbolic story of a mythical character called Pura\u00f1jana: King Pura\u00f1jana lived in a city of nine gates. He represents a living being who dwells within a body with nine holes (mouth, ears, eyes and so on). He would kill innocent animals in the forest by hunting. He was too engrossed with materialistic affairs and didn't take interest in spiritual life. Eventually he died while thinking of his wife. Then the soldiers of Yamar\u0101ja, the lord of death, dragged him to hell. After undergoing hellish suffering, he was born as a woman. In this manner, if a person is too absorbed in materialistic activities due to material desires, one has to take birth again and again in various species. The only way to stop this cycle of birth and death is to clean the mind from all material desires. The best way to purify the mind is to perform bhakti unto Lord Krsna under the guidance of a guru. Bhakti is very joyful and takes us to the eternal world of God. Narada Muni then narrated another story, Once a deer was grazing on grass and enjoying with his wife in a serene garden filled with fragrant flowers. The deer relished the songs of the bumblebees swarming around in the garden. But, in his great joy, the deer didn't notice a hungry tiger coming in front of him. Also, a hunter was hiding behind a tree to shoot the deer with his arrows. But the deer didn't notice these two dangers, absorbed in his enjoyment. Similarly, a materialistic person becomes absorbed in temporary enjoyment and doesn't notice the passage of time (tiger) and the Lord of death (hunter) standing behind. In short, Narada Muni indicated to Pracinabarhi that he was neglecting his spiritual by being too absorbed in material activities, Narada for saving him from hellish life. Inspired Prancinabarhi was determined to leave the kingdom and exclusively worship the Lord. At that time, his sons, the Pracet\u0101s, were still in the forest, but he didn't wait for their return. He ordered his ministers to inform his sons to protect the citizens. He wanted to take shelter of Lord Krsna without any further delay. So, he departed for a place called Kapil\u0101\u015brama and constantly worshiped Lord Krsna and eventually reached the spiritual world. Well, Pranc\u012bnabarhi attained a spiritual destination, but what happened to his sons, the Pracet\u0101s, performing austerities in the forest? Jump ahead to discover!",
        "quotes": "By killing innocent animals, one has to suffer serious reactions in the future, although one may seem unaffected in the present., Bhakti-yoga is the way to end our miseries in this world and reach the Lord for an eternal life., One must use one's precious time very carefully. Even a single moment that has passed won't come back.",
        "trivia": "DID YOU KNOW? ANIMAL SACRIFICES In the previous yugas, old animals like a horse or a cow were sacrificed as a part of a yaj\u00f1a, so that the sacrificial animal would be elevated to human life by the power of mantras chanted by pure br\u0101hma\u0146as. Such scarifies conducted benefit the performer, the common people, and even the animal. However, if there is a slight discrepancy in the yaj\u00f1a, the animal wouldn't get a human life, and the performer would incur immense sin instead of piety. In in the present age of Kali-yuga, due to the lack of such powerful br\u0101hma\u0146as, animal sacrifices are completely prohibited. The recommended sacrifice for this age is hari-n\u0101ma-sa\u0144k\u012brtana, or the process of chanting the holy names of Lord Hari.",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON NON-VIOLENCE: Violence is not just to kill or harm the physical bodies of other people. To unnecessarily cause distress to others' minds by one's words or actions is also violence. Scriptures and saints prohibit violence, and teach us to be kind towards all living beings. One should be non-violent not only towards human beings, but towards animals too. Just as we are pained by others' violence towards us, others also feel pain when we are violent. Knowing this, noble people treat all living beings with empathy and kindness. However, sometimes violence is necessary to punish vicious people and to establish dharma. Especially k\u00f1atriyas use violence as a tool to teach a lesson to the miscreants and protect the innocent.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4",
        "story": "Being pleased with the ten-thousand years long worship of the Pracetas, Lord Visnu mercifully appeared before them. He manifested His graceful eight-handed form on the back of Garuda, His eternal eagle carrier. With His soothing beauty, He enchanted their eyes and completely satisfied their hearts. He wore dazzling yellow garments, a fragrant garland, a dazzling crown, and the Kaustubha-mani necklace. He held various magnificent weapons in His eight hands. With a compassionate glance, Lord Visnu blessed the Pracetas and said, My dear princes, I bestow all good fortune upon you. I am very pleased with Your friendly dealings and sincerity in bhakti. Your cooperation and unity in devotion unto Me has completely captivated My heart. You may ask any benediction from Me. Lord Visnu generously gave the Pracetas some boons even without asking. He said, Those who remember you every evening will also develop close friendships with their brothers and all living beings. Those who glorify Me with the Rudra-g\u012bta prayers will receive My benedictions. Then the Lord instructed them to marry a beautiful girl called Marisa, who was like the daughter of the trees. He said, All of you, Pracet\u0101s, please marry her because your natures are very similar to hers. She is very obedient, just as you all are obedient to your father. Therefore, she should be the wife of all of you. By my blessings you will have a famous son whose progeny will fill the three worlds. Although it's quite unusual for a girl marry multiple husbands, the Lord's direct blessings made it possible. Only in some exceptional cases can a girl marry multiple husbands, provided she can treat all her husbands equally. One such example was Draupadi, who married the five Pandavas. Lord Visnu continued, Dear Pracet\u0101s, you can enjoy all facilities of this world and heaven with full bodily strength for one million celestial years. Then you will develop pure devotion unto Me and surely attain Me after leaving this world. Overwhelmed by the Lord's mercy, the Pracetas offered their heartfelt prayers unto Him in a faltering voice. They said, O Lord, You relieve all the distresses of Your devotees. We just want to chant Your all-auspicious name and hear Your unlimited pastimes life after life. We only desire Your satisfaction. What further benediction may we ask? We don't even want liberation. A bee approaching a p\u0101rij\u0101ta tree cannot leave it because it finds an abundance of honey there. Similarly, we cannot leave Your shelter, for it provides endless spiritual bliss. The Pracetas recollected that it was only by Lord \u015aiva's mercy that they were able to get Lord Vi\u015fnu's grace. With their hearts filled with gratitude for Siva, they spoke to Visnu, O Lord, even a moment's association of a pure devotee cannot be compared to heavenly happiness or even liberation. We can see You now having been empowered by a brief association with Lord \u015aiva, who taught us the Rudra-g\u012bta. Your devotees always discuss Your topics, and in their discussions, You are personally present with them. All we want is their association. The Lord granted the desires of the Pracet\u0101s and departed from there, although their eyes were not yet completely satiated seeing Him. The Pracetas then came out of the sea and discovered something very astonishing. The next chapter reveals that! So, delve in right away!",
        "quotes": "Real unity can be achieved by keeping the service and satisfaction of God in the center.,  Loving relationships and cooperation amongst devotees greatly please the Lord.,  When we glorify the good qualities of the Lord and His devotees, we also develop those qualities., A devotee is not interested in wealth.

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON UNITY: Have you seen how a team of footballers works as ane unit despite being different individuals to win match? This spirit of oneness that binds diverse people for a noble cause is called unity. No two human beings are alike in all aspects. We differ in forms, desires, tastes, working styles, etc. This diversity in human society makes it beautiful. We need to respect and love each other despite our differences. When siblings are friendly and stay united, the parents become pleased. Similarly, when all the living beings cooperatively co-exist, the Lord, their Supreme Father, becomes happy. This unity in diversity and loving relationships attract God's blessings.",

        "story": "After Lord Visnu departed, the Pracetas came out of the sea. To their surprise, they saw tall trees everywhere. When they were worshiping the Lord in the water, their father, Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi, had retired from the kingdom. Because there was no king to see to the management of the kingdom, the Earth became overgrown with trees. When too many trees grow everywhere, there won't be sufficient land for agriculture. The Pracet\u0101s became outraged. They wanted to clear the Earth of unnecessary trees to produce food grains. So they generated fire and wind from their mouths and started burning all the trees. Soma, the moon god, felt sympathy for the trees and immediately appeared there and spoke to the Pracetas, Control your intense anger! Please do not kill these poor trees. They are needed to maintain your citizens because they provide fruits and other eatables to everyone Let the remaining trees be happy. As the Lord had instructed you, accept this girl M\u0101ris\u0101 as your wife. Lord Brahm\u0101 also appeared there to pacify the Pracet\u0101s and advised them to marry M\u0101ris\u0101. The Pracet\u0101s then married M\u0101ris\u0101 and ruled the kingdom righteously. Daksa was born as their son. This was the same Daksa who had offended Lord \u015aiva in his previous life. After ruling the kingdom for thousands of years, the Pracetas left their wife M\u0101ris\u0101 in the care of their son Daksa and retired. After that, they all went to the seashore, worshiped the Lord, and constantly meditated upon Him. Once, Narada Muni came came to see the Pracet\u0101s. They respectfully offered a seat to N\u0101rada Muni and inquired from him, O great sage, it is our great fortune to see you. Your movements are like that of the sun which drives away all fear and the darkness of night. But, unfortunately, because of ruling the kingdom for a long time, we almost forgot the spiritual teachings of Lord \u015aiva and Lord Visnu. Therefore, kindly enlighten us in spiritual knowledge. N\u0101rada Muni replied, Dear Pracet\u0101s, one's birth, activities, life-span, mind, and words are perfected by bhakti unto Lord Krsna. For example, watering the root of a tree, its trunk, branches, twigs, and everything else gets energized. But just by sprinkling water on the branches and leaves, the plant wouldn't survive without watering the root. Likewise, all the senses and bodily limbs are nourished by supplying food to the stomach. Similarly, by worshiping the Supreme Lord Krsna, all the devat\u0101s are satisfied. The Lord is one, yet He mercifully becomes the Supersoul of all living beings. Therefore, perform unalloyed bhakti unto Him. Having thus enlightened the Pracet\u0101s, Narada Muni departed. Hearing from Narada the glories of the Lord, the Pracet\u0101s continued to worship Him with intense devotion, and finally attained His abode. What happened to the Pracet\u0101s' kingdom after their departure? Did their son Daksa rule it? Or did it decay and disappear? Unfold the mystery on the next page!",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON GUIDANCE: Guidance from wise people is required in every walk of life. Especially in spiritual life, one needs guidance from mature devotees at all stages. The Pracetas were guided by Lord Shiva when they just began to perform bhakti. They were guided by Lord Brahma and the moon god when they became outraged. Narada Muni guided them after their retirement. This guidance from great people is beneficial and essential in life. One shouldn't be overconfident and think that one can lead life independently. Instead, one should seek advice from the wise by humbly serving them and asking relevant questions.",

In the dynasty of Utt\u0101nap\u0101da there were several great kings like Dhruva, Anga, Prthu, and the Pracetas. The son of the Pracetas was Daksa. After the Pracet\u0101s retired, Daksa didn't take charge of the kingdom but went to perform austerities to please Lord Visnu. So, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu became concerned about the kingdom. Seeing no alternative, Manu wanted his other son Priyavrata to take charge of the kingdom. But at that time, Priyavrata was in the forest. He had no desire to marry or become a king. So he remained as a brahmac\u0101ri and accepted N\u0101rada Muni as his guru. Under the guidance of N\u0101rada Muni, he attained spiritual knowledge and worshiped Lord Krsna. He was absorbed in discussing the topics of the Lord and was uninterested in anything else. Hoping to crown Priyavrata, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu went to the forest to meet him. He reached Gandham\u0101dana Hill, where he saw Priyavrata and N\u0101rada Muni. Manu spoke to Priyavrata, My dear son, your brother's dynasty has ruled the earth so far. Now there is no one amongst his descendants to protect the citizens. So I request you to take charge of the kingdom, because you possess all the good qualities required by a king. Although the father's order cannot be refused, Priyavrata did not welcome it. He feared that being a king would distract him from bis bhakti. Moreover, he didn't want any diversion in his exclusive devotional service to the Lord. Understanding the situation, Lord Brahm\u0101, the father of Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, appeared there from Brahmaloka on his mighty swan carrier. He was accompanied by his associates and many devat\u0101s who praised him. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu and Narada Muni saw their father Brahma and immediately stood up in great respect and praised Brahma eloquently. Then Lord Brahm\u0101 looked at Priyavrata with love. He smiled, thinking that he would change his grandson's decision. He thought to himself, Dear grandson, to refuse the kingdom is your stubbornness. To make you rule the kingdom is my stubbornness. Let us see whose stubbornness will prevail. Such joking competitions are common between a grandson and a grandfather. Brahma then compassionately spoke to Priyavrata, The Supreme Lord desires that you take charge of the kingdom. Nobody can defy the Lord's order. All of us, including Siva, Manu, and N\u00e4rada, must carry out His instructions. He is our supreme well-wisher, and whatever He offers to us must be accepted with faith. Addressing Priyavrata's concern about his spiritual life, Brahma said, Please don't think managing a great kingdom will distract you from bhakti. For those who are disciplined and self-controlled, household life and a kingdom are not harmful. If you always seek the shelter of Lord Krsna with devotion, you will never deviate from bhakti. Thus being advised, Priyavrata bowed to Brahm\u0101 and agreed to rule the earth. Svayambhuva Manu felt relieved and happy. N\u0101rada Muni had no objections. Having thus convinced his grandson and being pleased with his obedience and selflessness, Brahm\u0101 departed. With the permission and blessings of Narada Muni, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu established Priyavrata as the king. King Priyavrata ruled the kingdom with great commitment. He married two queens and had thirteen sons and one daughter. Although he had no interest in the kingdom, he ruled the world just to honor the orders of his elders. He promptly attended to his various responsibilities, yet he never forgot to worship Lord Krsna. Once Priyavrata had become dissatisfied with the movements of the sun. The sun lit up half the earth's surface while the other half remained dark. Priyavrata wanted to give light to the other half by becoming a second sun in the universe. So, by the power of his yoga, he expanded himself into two forms, one as the king and one as the sun. He then followed the orbit of the sun-god on a brilliant chariot and thus turned night into day. By dissipating the darkness of night, Priyavrata wanted to give happiness to his citizens. But he never wanted to compete with the sun. Priyavrata was cooler than the moon in hot months like Jyestha. And in cold months like M\u0101rga\u015b\u012br\u1e63a, he was warmer than the other sun at dawn and dusk. As Priyavrata was moving on his chariot following the sun's orbit, the impressions of his chariot wheels created seven ring-shaped ditches. They became the seven great oceans. Naturally, seven great islands were formed between the seven oceans on the Bh\u016b-mandala (the earthly plane). After successfully ruling the earth for thousands of years, Priyavrata desired to retire. So he made seven of his thirteen sons the rulers of the seven islands he had created. Three of the remaining sons became brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, and the other three sons became Manus in the future. Priyavrata spent the rest of his life worshiping Lord Krsna as taught to him by his guru N\u0101rada Muni. He thus finally attained the kingdom of God. What happened to the kingdom then?

        "quotes": "One who extends oneself to fulfill the desires of great people shall receive great blessings., When we are sincere, the Lord will help us balance our social duties and spiritual life nicely., Wise people intend to help others but not compete with others or outsmart them., Just as the Lord performs astonishing pastimes, His devotees also perform wonderful activities by His empowerment.",

When we have an earnest desire to attain success, sincerely endeavor for it, and humbly offer prayer to the Lord, the Lord empowers us to accomplish the unimaginable. The Lord significantly empowers His devotees to succeed in their endeavors because the devotees eagerly participate in His mission. Lord Krishna empowered Arjuna and Bhima to become the heroes of the Kurukshetra battle. Lord Rama empowered Hanuman to find Sitadevi, burn Lanka, and terrorize the hearts of all the demons headed by Ravana.",

        "story": "Priyavrata's first son was named \u0100gn\u012bdhra. He ruled the Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa, the middlemost island in the Bh\u016bmandala. He protected the citizens like his own children. Desiring to get a perfect son Agn\u012bdhra worshipped Lord Brahm\u0101 in the valley of Mandara Hill. Understanding \u0100gn\u012bdhra's desire, Brahm\u0101 sent a beautiful damsel named P\u016brvacitti to him. Agn\u012bdhra married her, and they begot nine great sons who became the rulers of the nine parts of Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa. N\u0101bhi, the eldest son of \u0100gn\u012bdhra, ruled Bh\u0101rata-varsa, a prominent part of the Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa. His queen was called Merudev\u012b. Desiring to have children, N\u0101bhi and Merudev\u012b requested some pure br\u0101hma\u0146a priests to conduct a great sacrifice for the mercy of Lord Visnu. N\u0101bhi prayed to the Lord with great faith and devotion. Being very affectionate to His sincere devotees, Lord Visnu appeared on the back of Garuda in the sacrifice of King N\u0101bhi. He wore a yellow silk garment, fragrant garlands, a Kaustubha gem, a dazzling crown, a pearl necklace, and various ornaments. He held conch, lotus, disc, and club in His four hands. Seeing the Lord, King N\u0101bhi, his priests, and others felt like poor people who had obtained great riches. The Lord's unparalleled beauty captivated everyone's eyes and satisfied their hearts. The priests prayed to Lord Visnu, O Lord, please accept our respects, for we are Your servants. Your name, form, and qualities are all divine. Chanting Your glories is auspicious and wipes out the sins of all mankind. You are certainly very satisfied when Your devotees offer You prayers, Tulasi leaves, and water. Nabhi's priests then expressed the purpose of their sacrifice, O Lord, although we are foolish, ignorant and have not worshipped You properly, You have mercifully appeared in this sacrifice. Your appearance itself is the greatest benediction for us. Seeing You is extremely rare. We called You here because king N\u0101bhi desired a son like You. Lord Visnu was pleased. He spoke with compassion, You are all qualified br\u0101hmanas. Your words should not prove untrue. You have prayed for King N\u0101bhi to have a son like Me. But I am the Supreme Person, and there is no one like Me. Therefore, I will personally appear as the son of Nabhi. Speaking thus, the Lord disappeared from the sacrifice. Lord Visnu appeared as the son of Nabhi and Merudev\u012b. He manifested the symptoms of God when He was born. N\u0101bhi named Him Rsabhadeva, the best of human beings. N\u0101bhi was always blissful, having attained his desire for a perfect son, the Lord Himself. He affectionately raised the Lord, who acted like a human being. To train his son in protecting the citizens, N\u0101bhi entrusted Him to learned br\u0101hma\u0146as. Rsabhadeva completed his education first in a Gurukul (school) and gave guru-daksi\u0146\u0101 (donation of gratitude) to His gurus. Rsabhadeva became popular amongst the citizens and ministers. Everyone became happy seeing His good qualities, powers, strength, beauty, name, fame, and influence. Eventually Nabhi enthroned Rsabhadeva. Thereafter Nabhi and Merudevi went to Badarik\u0101\u015brama, where they worshipped Nara-N\u0101r\u0101yana in deep devotion. In due course of time, they went to Vaikuntha.

Although He is far beyond the reach of a materialistic person, He is easily approachable to those who love Him and eagerly serve Him. It's love that makes the inconceivable Lord accessible to all.

        "title": "A Divine Downpour",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 4 and 5",
        "story": "Indra, the lord of rains, had once stopped the rains in Bh\u0101rata-varsa. This was due to his envy of the exalted Lord Rsabha. Rsabhadeva then profusely poured rain into Bh\u0101rata-varsa by His spiritual power. This humbled Indra. He then offered a woman named Jayanti as the wife of Lord Rsabhadeva. Rsabhadeva had a hundred sons who are similar to Himself in good qualities. Bharata, the eldest of all, was an exalted devotee. In his honor, this planet became known as Bh\u0101rata-varsa. All the hundred sons of Rsabhadeva were ksatriyas by birth. But only ten of them, headed by Bharata, became ksatriyas with courage and power. Eighty-one sons were expert br\u0101hmanas, perfect in Vedic knowledge and rituals. And the remaining nine sons became very advanced devotees together called the nava-yogendras. They became authorized teachers of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavatam and were glorified for their strong devotion to Lord Vasudeva. Lord Rsabhadeva was well-versed with Vedas and merciful to all. To set a right example as a king, He conducted several sacrifices according to Vedic injunctions, followed the advice of brahma\u0146as, and strictly observed dharma. In His rule, the citizens were fully satisfied. Once Lord Rsabhadeva toured the world and reached a place called Brahm\u0101varta. In an assembly of many br\u0101hmanas, sages, and common people, He gave wonderful teachings to His good sons. He told them, My dear sons, all living beings need some enjoyment, but temporary material enjoyment is not the only goal of human life. In comparison to animals, human beings have higher intelligence by which they can cultivate spiritual knowledge and come closer to God. This is possible in the company of devotees who are dedicated to bhakti. Rsabhadeva continued, One has to develop love for Lord Vasudeva by hearing about Him and chanting His names. Then one can easily be liberated from material miseries and reach the spiritual world. The leaders of society must mercifully educate innocent people in devotion. Following your eldest brother, Bharata, protect your citizens effectively and never disrespect pure br\u0101hma\u0146as as they are very dear to the Lord. In this way, Lord Rsabhadeva instructed His sons, although they were perfectly educated and cultured. He was instructing everyone through His sons. Enthroning Bharata as the king of Bh\u0101rata-varsa, R\u1e63abhadeva took a vow of silence and left home to tour the world. He acted like an avadh\u016bta who externally appears like a madman but is internally absorbed in spiritual consciousness. Foolish people threatened and threw stones and dust at Him, but He remained indifferent like an elephant surrounded by flies. He was situated in His spiritual glory, and didn't care for these material insults. Even as an avadh\u016bta, He appeared beautiful in His divine spiritual body. Although R\u1e63abhadeva had all mystic powers, He never displayed them to attract the public's attention. He neglected all yogic powers and was absorbed in spiritual consciousness. He exhibited deep detachment in the final stages of His pastimes, just to teach everyone that this material world is not a worthy place for living. He wandered all over the earth and reached Karnataka state in South India. There He concluded His earthly pastimes by entering a forest fire created by the rubbing of bamboo due to the force of the wind. All the animals and trees in that forest attained liberation due to the presence of Rsabhadeva. How did Bharata rule the kingdom after Rsabhadeva's departure?",
        "quotes": "Envious people cannot tolerate the glory of others. Envy is an indirect appreciation of others. Better to appreciate them directly and be relieved from the burden of envy., In the Vedic culture, people are accepted as brahmanas or kshatriyas not by their birth, but by their qualities & activities., One needs to avoid the company of bad people and associate with good people., When God descends as an incarnation, He performs enchanting activities & gives enlightening teachings to humanity.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 5",
        "story": "King Bharata, the first son of Lord Rsabhadeva, protected the earth following his father's footsteps. Being a learned king, he perfectly performed his duties and inspired his citizens to execute their duties. He was free from qualities like envy, greed, or attachments. Bharata performed various sacrifices without any material desires, just to worship Lord Krsna with love. He performed bhakti by hearing Krsna's pastimes, chanting His names, and meditating upon His qualities and forms. After ruling the Earth for 10,000,000 years, he divided his wealth among his five sons and retired as a king. Then, he went to a peaceful place called Pulah\u0101\u015brama, where the Gandaki River flows, and \u015b\u0101lagr\u0101ma-\u015bil\u0101s are obtainable. At Pulah\u0101\u015brama, Lord Hari is visible even now in the form desired by the devotees, out of His affection for them. Bharata lived there alone. He would bathe in the Gandaki River and worship Lord Hari with various flowers, tulas\u012b leaves, and water from the river. His heart was completely satisfied with such selfless worship of the Lord. His love for the Lord increased day by day, and he showed symptoms of spiritual joy and tears of affection for Him. Once, after finishing his morning duties, Bharata sat on the bank of River Gandaki and chanted some prayers. At that time, a thirsty Pregnant doe came there. As she started drinking water from the river peacefully, she suddenly heard the roar of a lion. She became very frightened and quickly leaped across the river though she had not yet quenched her thirst. When she thus jumped in fear, her baby fell from her womb into the flowing waters. Being thus distressed and separated from its flock, the doe died on the spot. Seeing the newborn fawn floating down the river, Bharata felt great compassion and immediately lifted it from the water. Then, knowing the fawn to be motherless, he brought it to his \u0101\u015brama. Bharata began to raise the helpless deer as his child. However, by being so absorbed in maintaining the deer, he gradually neglected to worship the Lord. Finally, he thought, The deer has taken my shelter with full faith. Hence I should selflessly raise and protect it, even at the cost of neglecting my spiritual practices. Due to excessive affection for the deer, Bharata lay down, walked about, bathed, and even ate with it. Fearing that ferocious animals might kill the deer, Bharata took it with him wherever he went in the forest. He would carry the deer on his shoulders, sometimes keep it on his lap or, when sleeping, on his chest. Thus, he felt great bliss in petting it. While he was worshipping the Lord, he would get up and see where the deer was. Seeing it, he would be satisfied and bless it, saying, My dear calf, may you be happy in all ways. Having compassion for the deer wasn't wrong on the part of Bharata, but being overly attached to it and neglecting his s\u0101dhana was his mistake. Once, the deer wandered into the forest, leaving Bharata. Not seeing the deer, Bharata became anxious, like a miser who has lost his wealth. Did the deer get lost? Did Bharata find it again? Read on to find out.",
        "quotes": "Spiritual practices done with absorption, without any distraction offer great joy to the heart., Life is unpredictable.

Try to remember a goal you want to achieve. Then, identify what distracts you from the goal, and share how you would like to overcome them.",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON ATTENTION: Attentiveness is one of the important qualities needed to achieve anything. So many unexpected distractions come on our way to attain our goals. We fail if we divert our attention from what is beneficial to what is not. So we need to be constantly alert to deal with distractions. How is that possible? The most effective way of saving oneself from distraction is a good association. However knowledgeable and determined one may be, one can lose focus on goals due to distractions, as we see in the case of the Bharata. But if we keep the company of well-wishing like-minded friends, they will remind us of our goals whenever we are distracted.",

        "title": "A Deer's Past Life Memories",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 5",
        "story": "King Bharata, who was once immersed in the thoughts of Lord Krsna, became immersed in the thoughts of the lost deer. Unable to understand his emotions and attachment, Bharata became very sorrowful. He thought, Oh, I am so negligent and cruel like a hunter. Perhaps the deer lost faith in me and left me. Oh, shall I see it again? Will the Lord protect the deer? When will I see him wandering again in the garden eating soft grass? Bharata desired the deer's safety and remembered its cute activities. He said to himself, Perhaps the deer has been eaten by a wild animal. Seeing my fake meditation, it would move around me and touch me with its soft horns, which felt like drops of water. Then, when I chastise him by pushing it away for disturbing my worship, it would sit down motionlessly. Although Bharata was in worship or mediation, his mind was thinking of the deer. After thus speaking like a madman, Bharata went outside and saw the deer's footprints fortunate to have the deer's beautiful and auspicious footprints. He on the ground. He thought the Earth was thus lamented till the sunset. Seeing the dark marks on the rising moon that resembled a deer, he said, Has the compassionate moon given shelter to the deer? Is Seeing the dark marks on the rising moon that resembled a deer, he protecting it from the fearful attacks of a lion? Unfortunately, Bharata was overwhelmed by an uncontrollable desire to see the deer and forget his spiritual goals. Bharata was free from all bad qualities and had many good qualities like compassion. However, his compassion for the deer became a distraction in his spiritual life due to his inattentiveness. Bharata's thoughts about the deer increased with time, and his life span decreased. Finally, the time of death, which is like a venomous snake entering a mouse hole, approached him. Bharata imagined the deer by his side like his own son. Absorbed in thinking of the deer while leaving his body, Bharata died. Because he was immersed in the thoughts of the deer, he was born as a deer in his next life, in the K\u0101la\u00f1jara Mountain area. Although king Bharata became deer Bharata, he could understand the cause of his deer birth. He thus lamented, Oh, what misfortune! I gave up my kingdom and opulence to worship and remember Lord Krsna. But out of foolishness, I became attached to the young deer and became an animal now. I should have been more careful and not neglected my spiritual duties. To increase Bharata's devotion, the Lord punished him with a deer body for a short time. However, the Lord was merciful to him and gave him the remembrance of his past life, even in an animal body. Deer Bharata became anxious to get out of his deer body. He intensified his bhakti. Thus, this punishment was a blessing for Bharata. Thus, deer Bharata constantly repented for his mistake. He left his mother deer at K\u0101la\u00f1jara Mountain and again went to Pulah\u0101\u015brama. Now deer Bharata was cautious not to fall victim to any distractions to spiritual life. Deer Bharata ate dry leaves, grass, and bushes. He bathed in that holy place and always meditated on the Lord. Taking Param\u0101tm\u0101 as his companion, he awaited his natural death. In this way, he spent his life in the body of a deer but the mind of a devotee. Finally, he gave up that deer body one day. What happened next? Did he take rebirth or attain the spiritual world?

        "quotes": "Even kindness can create complications in life if it's reposed in the wrong way., A mere show of worship while thinking of something else is not truly beneficial., Whatever is one thinks of at the time of death, one attains that. If one remembers God at the time of death, one reaches God., Behind the strictness of God is His soft heart, due to which He cannot disown His devotees even if they make mistakes.",
        "activity": "1. Recollect an incident where you felt that due to God's mercy, you made an accomplishment? 2. Did you experience something that you felt as a rebuke but later realized it as a blessing? 3. Do you remember anyone else in the Bhagavatam who was punished for a mistake but took it positively?",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON MERCY: God loves all living beings unconditionally. Especially when they worship Him with devotion, His attention towards them increases. Even if the devotees commit some mistakes, or get distracted from bhakti, the Lord's mercy on them doesn't diminish. On the contrary, just to bring them back on track, He mercifully punishes them so that they can reconnect with rejuvenated devotion. The Lord's mercy comes in multiple forms. Although it may not be palatable sometimes, it's always beneficial. After all, He is our supreme well-wisher. We can access His mercy by attentively practicing our spiritual life.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 5",
        "story": "Once in the dynasty of sage Angira, there was a gentle and learned br\u0101hmana who had two wives. His first wife gave birth to nine sons while the second wife gave birth to twins a girl and a boy. That boy was Bharata who took birth as the son of this br\u0101hmana, after giving up the body of a deer. By the Lord's grace, Bharata remembered his past two lives as a king and as a deer. Learning from his past mistakes, he always thought about Krsna in his present birth. Although the new family members of Bharata were good in their habits and culture, they were not so elevated in spiritual life. Moreover, they were somewhat materialistic in their attitude. So, Bharata was very cautious in associating with them because he didn't want to get distracted this time. Externally, Bharata behaved like a dumb man to avoid bad association, but internally he always thought of his dear Lord Krsna. Considering him foolish, people called him Jada Bharata, jada meaning 'dull.' Jada Bharata's father was always affectionate to him. He tried to educate him in various ways, teach him cleanliness, Vedic mantras, and other etiquettes of br\u0101hma\u0146as. Bharata acted like a fool before his father and did the opposite of what his father taught, just to stop him teaching any further. Although instructed to wash his hands after father tried to teach him the Gayatri mantra along with o\u1e41k\u0101ra, but excreting, Bharata would wash his hands before. Nonetheless, his even after four months of attempt, he was unsuccessful. It wasn't necessary for Jada Bharata to learn these basic principles because he was already advanced in spiritual life. Moreover, he didn't want any emotional bondage with people. His father finally realized that Bharata was unfit for marriage and household life. Without fulfilling his desire to make Jada Bharata a scholar, the br\u0101hmana died. After his departure, the nine stepbrothers of Jada Bharata stopped his education. Although learned in the Vedas, they were not spiritually inclined or kind. They considered Bharata brainless, and couldn't understand his exalted position. Insensitive people made Bharata do physical work as a slave and addressed him as mad, dull, and dumb. Yet Bharata neither protested nor tried to prove himself great. He would eat whatever food came of its own accord without any desire to satisfy his tongue. He was wise and a liberated person, fully satisfied in his meditation on the Lord. Jada Bharata looked as strong as a bull. He did not cover his body fully with proper cloth despite too much cold, heat, or rain. He wore only a dirty loincloth, and his sacred thread was blackish. He would lay on the ground without a bath. His spiritual knowledge was covered, like a gem covered by dirt. Ignorant people called him brahma-bandhu, an unqualified br\u0101hmana. Being thus insulted and neglected by materialistic people, Jada Bharata wandered here and there. Jada Bharata would work only for food. Taking advantage of this, his stepbrothers engaged him in agricultural work. They would give him broken rice and worm-eaten grains that were stuck to the cooking pot. But ada Bharata gladly accepted all this as if it were nectar. Bharata was determined to finish his business in this material world, not caring for any insults or attachments. He just wanted to meditate on Krsna internally and reach Him. While thus living his life, suddenly one day, a band of dacoits arrested him, intending to kill him. Did the dacoits kill him? Or did Bharata escape? Read on to find out!",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON TOLERANCE: Sometimes people may taunt us or comment on us unnecessarily. We may have to respond to them appropriately. In the name of tolerance, we need not allow ourselves to get exploited. When others consider us foolish, we may try to prove our talent. If they consider us cheaters, we may prove our innocence. However, sometimes tolerating can be a better choice. When a regal elephant passes on the road carrying the Lord's deity on his back, some street dogs may bark at him, but the elephant focuses on his service to the Lord. If proving ourselves in front of others is unworthy of our time and energy, we may prefer not to respond to them and focus on our good work. But in doing so, we shouldn't be proud or arrogant. If others' feedback or comments help us improve ourselves, we should accept them positively.",

        "story": "Once, the leader of some dacoits desiring to have a son worshiped goddess K\u0101li. To please her, he wanted to offer in sacrifice a dull man who was no better than an animal (puru\u1e63a-pa\u015bu). His followers forcefully caught a foolish man; however, he escaped at the last moment. So, the leader ordered the dacoits to find him immediately. Wandering here and there in the middle of the night, the dacoits found Jada Bharata, who was guarding a paddy field. After observing him closely, they felt that he was foolish like an animal and thus a perfect choice for their human sacrifice. Being overjoyed with their find, they immediately arrested Bharata and brought him to the temple of goddess K\u0101l\u012b. But Bharata didn't even protest. The leader of the cruel dacoits became pleased and began performing their imaginary ritual. There was no mention in the scriptures of sacrificing a human being however dull he may be. Moreover, Bharata was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and a great devotee. But the dacoits were bent upon performing the sacrifice. According to their concocted procedure, the dacoits first bathed Bharata, dressed him in new clothes, and then decorated him with ornaments, sandalwood pulp, garlands, and tilaka. Then, they fed him sumptuously and made him sit in front of the huge deity of Bhadra K\u0101li. Finally, they offered her arati, prayers, and their so-called devotion for a selfish purpose. The chief priest then picked up a fearsome sword and chanted a mantra of Bhadra K\u0101l\u012b. Desiring to offer her the blood of Jada Bharata so that she may drink it as liquor, he raised his sword to behead him. The low-minded and envious dacoits, whose business was just to plunder people, didn't realize the gravity of their offense to Jada Bharata. How can K\u0101li be pleased with the blood of a pure devotee of Lord Visnu? After all, she is also a devotee of Visnu. K\u0101l\u012b couldn't tolerate the sinful dacoits offending Jada Bharata. Her deity burst open and she emerged from it in a form burning with an intolerable effulgence. The angry goddess displayed her fierce, curved teeth, frowning brows and glowing reddish eyes. She manifested a fierce mood, as if to destroy the entire creation for the offence being performed towards an innocent devotee. Leaping violently from the altar, she immediately beheaded all those rogues with the very sword with which they tried to kill Jada Bharata. She then drank the hot blood that flowed from their necks as if it were liquor. Despite all these events, Jada Bharata was calm. He didn't desire harm for them even in his mind. He is no one's enemy. As Jada Bharata continued to live in this way, he encountered a king who insulted him. This time Jada Bharata didn't keep silent. He responded to the king strongly. Who was that king? And what was the dispute? To know the details, read the next story.",

But some desires are reasonable and some are not. One may endeavor to fulfill one's reasonable desires by honest means. However, if one pursues one's selfish desires even at the cost of troubling innocent people, one ends up in trouble like the dacoits. We can regulate our desires by scriptural study and good association. Positive desires are beneficial to oneself and others. Especially desires to serve the Lord elevate us to His company.",

        "story": "King Rah\u016bgana, the ruler of Sindhu and Sauv\u012bra provinces, was once on his way to Kapil\u0101\u015brama. His servants carried him on a beautiful palanquin. However, as they reached the riverbank, they needed another person who could carry the palanquin. So they began searching for someone. By chance, they saw young and strong Jada Bharata who was fit enough for the job. So, they forcefully brought him and made him carry the king's palanquin. While carrying the palanquin Jada Bharata saw some ants on the road. He didn't want to step on them due to his sense of compassion. So, he walked erratically, because of which the palanquin shook constantly. King Rah\u016bgana was disturbed so he asked the palanquin carriers the reason. They became afraid of punishment and said, O King, we are not negligent in our service. This new man does not walk swiftly, and therefore we cannot carry the palanquin with him. Although Rah\u016bgana was knowledgeable and had served great sages earlier, he became angry due to his innate nature as a king. Thus, he spoke to Jada Bharata sarcastically, Oh! You must be fatigued from carrying the palanquin alone for so long, because you are old, weak, and unhealthy. Are your fellow carriers not cooperating with you? By these words, Rah\u016bgana indicated to Jada Bharata that he was young, strong, was not fatigued, and therefore had no reason to perform poorly. Being unaffected by the king's sarcastic remarks, Bharata didn't respond and continued walking. After a while, King Rah\u016bgana noticed that his palanquin was still shaking. He then severely chastised Jada Bharata, Are you dead despite the life in your body? Are you mad? You are disregarding the orders of your master. For this disobedience, I shall punish you. Jada Bharata smiled and replied to the king, O King, as you rightly said, I am not fatigued because fatigue belongs only to the body. I a spirit soul detached from the body. My body may be strong and am a young, but these qualities don't apply to the soul. You said that you are the king, and I am your servant. But these positions are temporary and may change later. You said you would punish me, but that is useless, for I am a self-realized soul wandering like a madman. There is no use punishing a self-realized man or a mad man. Saying this, Jada Bharata continued to carry the palanquin as before. Hearing Bharata's profound reply, Rah\u016bgana immediately gave up his pride as a king, and fell flat at Bharata's feet. Then, humbly begging for forgiveness, he inquired, Who are you? Are you a learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a liberated saint like Dattatreya? Are you Lord Kapila or Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana? Why are you wandering around like a madman? Please mercifully reveal your identity. With a repentant heart, Rah\u016bgana further spoke, I am not afraid of Indra's thunderbolt, Lord \u015aiva's trident, Yamar\u0101ja's punishment, or the weapons of great devat\u0101s. But I am afraid of offending the br\u0101hmanas, sages, and devotees like yourself. So please forgive my offense committed without knowing your great position. Jada Bharata replied, I was the famous emperor Bharata in my past life. I was fully absorbed in the Lord's service but became distracted due to undue affection for a deer. Thus, I become a deer in the next life. But I could remember my previous life and meditated on Krsna even in a deer body. Thus, I have now attained this br\u0101hma\u0146a birth. To avoid material association, I am wandering about unnoticed. King Rah\u016bgana being astonished at understanding Bharata's elevated position inquired about various philosophical and spiritual subject matters from him. Bharata said, When the mind is absorbed in material enjoyment, it causes suffering. But when the same mind is attached to Krsna, it leads to liberation. The uncontrolled mind is the greatest enemy of the living entity. One can conquer the mind with the weapon of service to the devotees, guru, and Krsna. Rah\u016bgana expressed his gratitude to Bharata for his teachings while Bharata continued his wanderings and eventually attained the kingdom of God.",

Those who realize this are unaffected by bodily pains & pleasures., In ignorance, one may commit a mistake, but in knowledge, one regrets the mistake and tries to rectify it instead of justifying it., It is wise to apologize when we realize that we have offended someone. A delay would aggravate the reaction; just as delaying treatment can aggravate a disease.,  In the association of wise people, one is enlightened about the true purpose of life.",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON REGRET: Remember when you broke a window glass accidentally while playing? Making mistakes is common for any human being. But honest people do not commit mistakes or offend anyone purposefully. If they happen to commit an offense incidentally, they genuinely repent and try to rectify their mistakes. Such sincere regret is perfect atonement for their mistakes. King Rahugana would have been held up for his offense towards Ja\u00f2a Bharata, but his regret saved him, and made him a recipient of spiritual knowledge. Sincere repentance attracts forgiveness.",

        "story": "In a place called K\u0101nyakubja, lived a gentle and learned br\u0101hm named Ajamila. He was respectful and kind towards everyone and completely free from bad qualities. One day, Aj\u0101mila's father told him to collect some fruits and flowers from the forest for worship. On his way back home, he saw an unusual vulgar scene of a shameless man hugging a maidservant publicly. Both the man and the woman were drunk; their eyes were rolling in intoxication, and their dresses were loose. Seeing their inappropriate behavior, Aj\u0101mila was disturbed mentally. He tried to remember the scriptural instructions, but his mind went out of control. He left the spot, but the scene was haunting him. Ironically, he desired to marry that woman, although he already had a beautiful young wife coming from a respectable family. Aj\u0101mila's mind was covered with the thoughts of that bad lady. He lost all his good sense and became determined to be with her. Within a short time, he brought her as a servant into his house. Captivated by her so-called beauty, he started spending his inherited money to buy her various presentations so that she would remain pleased with him. Gradually losing all brahminical principles, he abandoned his chaste wife and parents. A br\u0101hmana is meant to please Lord Krsna, but Aj\u0101mila strove to fulfill the desires of a woman. Aj\u0101mila married that sinful lady and ate food cooked by her. By eating her remnants, he became impure and addicted to sinful activities. He would plunder people or cheat them in gambling in order to earn nis livelihood and maintain his children. As a result, he became a fraud, burglar, and drunkard. He led an irresponsible life, and thus eighty-eight years of his life passed. Aj\u0101mila had ten sons. Fortunately, by the mercy of some devotee, he named his youngest son 'N\u0101r\u0101yana.' N\u0101r\u0101yana was naturally very dear to his parents. Aj\u0101mila took great pleasure in his broken language and childish activities. With deep attachment and affection, Aj\u0101mila would often call out 'N\u0101r\u0101yana, N\u0101r\u0101yana' repeatedly. When he would eat, he would call the child, N\u0101r\u0101yana, come and sit, eat this food. When he would drink, he would call, N\u0101r\u0101yana, come and drink this juice. Thus, always taking care of the child, he didn't notice the passage of time. Eventually, old Ajamila became diseased and was neglected by his wife. Finally, when he was on his deathbed, he saw three terrifying personalities with twisted faces and erect hairs. They were the Yamad\u016btas, the soldiers of lord Yama, who would award suitable punishments to sinful people in hell. Aj\u0101mila had committed many sins with his body, mind, and words. Therefore, three Yamad\u016btas came to him with ropes to drag him to hell. Frightened, with tears in his eyes, Aj\u0101mila loudly called his son, N\u0101r\u0101yana, N\u0101r\u0101yana, who was playing nearby. Unfortunately, the boy didn't havethematurity to understand his father's situation and anxiety. Although the child 'N\u0101r\u0101yana' didn't respond to Aj\u0101mila's cries, Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana did. Ajamila had neglected to worship the Lord all these days, but the Lord's heart melted hearing him calling out His name helplessly. The Lord mercifully sent His servants, the Visnud\u016btas, to rescue him. Because dying Aj\u0101mila chanted four syllables of God's name N\u0101-r\u0101-ya-na, four Visnud\u016btas came to help him. How did the Yamad\u016btas respond when the Visnudutas suddenly intervened? Did the Visnud\u016btas save Aj\u0101mila from the Yamad\u016btas? Was there a fight between both parties?

Just imagine how much would He be kind to someone who lovingly chants His name? Although Ajamila accidentally became sinful, the Lord didn't give up His love for him. In ignorance, we ignore people who love us, and love those who have no intent or ability to reciprocate our love. But the Lord is ever willing to shower His grace upon us.

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 6",
        "story": "As the Yamad\u016btas were snatching the soul from the core of Ajamila's heart, the Visnud\u016btas stopped them. They threatened the Yamad\u016btas with resounding voices, If you want to live, do not take away this devotee Ajamila! The Yamad\u016btas were astonished to see and hear the Visnud\u016btas. The Visnud\u016btas looked very fresh and beautiful in yellow silk garments. Their faces were glowing with lotus-like eyes and dazzling crowns. Their four long arms held maces, bows, quivers of arrows, swords, clubs, conches, cakras and lotus flowers. They were also decorated with lotus garlands and jewelry. Their effulgence dissipated all darkness. The Yamad\u016btas had jurisdiction over all sinful people, but the Visnud\u016btas were capable of punishing anyone, including the Yamad\u016btas and even Yama, if they wrong a devotee of Visnu. The Yamad\u016btas were never obstructed by anyone before. They asked the Visnud\u016btas, Who are you? Are you some devat\u0101s? Why are you forbidding us of our duty? We are soldiers of Yama, the lord of death. The Visnud\u016btas smiled and replied gravely, You claim to be the servants of Yama, but you seem to be mere ghosts. If you are the servants of Yama, then explain what is dharma and what is adharma? What is the process of punishing sinful people? The Yamad\u016btas replied, The Vedas are given to humanity directly by Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana. Therefore, what is prescribed in the Vedas is dharma, and the opposite is adharma. The sun, fire, sky, air, devat\u0101s, moon, evening, day, night, water, the Supersoul, and Yama himself witness the activities of all living beings. Therefore, the candidates for punishment are those who are confirmed by these witnesses to have performed adharma. Aj\u0101mila performed many sinful acts without undergoing any atonement, so we must take him to hell, where he will be punished. The Visnud\u016btas replied, Aj\u0101mila has atoned for millions of lifetimes of sins just by uttering the name of 'N\u0101r\u0101yana' helplessly when he saw you. Even previously, whenever he called his son, he uttered the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101yana affectionately. By such chanting, although done unintentionally, he is purified of all his sinful reactions. That's the power of chanting the Lord's holy name. Simply by chanting the name of Lord Visnu, even sinful persons attract the attention of the Lord, who enthusiastically gives him all protection. Therefore, do not take Aj\u0101mila to hell. By chanting the name of 'N\u0101r\u0101yana,' he is free of all sinful reactions. The Visnud\u016btas continued, A person who chants the name of the Lord while falling, slipping, traveling, in pain, or being injured, will not suffer hellish punishment. As a fire burns dry grass to ashes, the Lord's holy name burns all sinful reactions, whether chanted knowingly or unknowingly. Just as powerful medicine acts even when taken without the knowledge of its powers, the Lord's holy name is effective even when the chanter utters it unknowingly. Having thus established the fact that Ajamila was purified of all sins, the Yamad\u016btas released Ajamila from imminent death. Thus defeated, the Yamad\u016btas left there to inform their master Yama about the incident. Although almost unconscious, Ajamila still heard the long coaxeration between the Yamad\u016btas and the Visnud\u016btas. While the Yamad\u016btas spoke ordinary principles of punishing a sinful person, the Visnud\u016btas spoke extraordinary principles of forgiveness and mercy upon a person who chanted the Lord's holy name. Aj\u0101mila bowed his head at the feet of the Visnud\u016btas. Then, as he was about to say something, the Vi\u015fnud\u016btas suddenly disappeared. Aj\u0101mila began to repent for his sinful life and spoke in self-reproach, Alas, I acted so sinfully and degraded my family tradition. I should be thrown into hell for my sins. But those effulgent men saved me from the fearsome men who came with ropes to arrest me. Was it a dream or a reality? Where have they gone? I must have seen them due to some previous spiritual activities. Aj\u0101mila's heart became overwhelmed with gratitude for the Vi\u015fnud\u016btas. Then, he resolved,Having gotten this second chance, I will give up my degraded habits, perform devotional service unto Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana, and chant His holy names with love and affection. Aj\u0101mila then went to a holy place called Hardwar, where he performed bhakti unto Visnu with full dedication. After thus living a purely spiritual life for twelve years, Aj\u0101mila gave up his material body on the bank of the River Ganges and attained a spiritual body appropriate to that of an associate of Lord Visnu. Then, accompanied by Visnud\u016btas, he boarded the golden airplane and went to Vaikuntha. But what happened to the Yamadutas? After they went back to hell, being defeated by the Visnud\u016btas, what did they tell Yama? Read ahead to find out!",
        "quotes": "Even unintentional and unconscious chanting of the Lord's name purifies one from all sins. Just imagine what will happen if one chants with love.,  While ordinary dharma proposes punishment, divine dharma suggests reformation and forgiveness., Repentance for mistakes, gratitude for those who help, and determination to come on the right path will soon bring one to perfection.",
        "activity": "1. Why do you think did the Lord Ajamila another chance? 2. Why didn't the Vishnudutas immediately take Ajamila to Vaikuntha? 3. What can you learn from Ajamila's guilt? 4. Is guilt good for a person?",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON DEVOTION: Ajamila's story is an exceptional example of the Lord's mercy. However, its message is not to encourage a sinful life and still save oneself from the reactions just by saying N\u0101r\u0101ya\u0146a at the end of life! God is merciful, but one shouldn't take undue advantage of God's forgiveness and purposely commit sins. The story is meant to help us appreciate the Lord's mercy and thus approach Him with devotion. Ajamila chanted 'N\u0101r\u0101yana' without faith what will happen if one chants with faith? Ajamila chanted 'N\u00e4r\u00e4yana' while dying what will happen if one chants while living? Aj\u00e4mila chanted 'N\u0101r\u0101ya\u0146a' to indicate his son what will happen if one chants to indicate the Lord? Aj\u00e4mila was very sinful what will happen if a sinless person chants 'N\u0101r\u0101yana'? If Ajamila had attained Vaikuntha, what to speak of one who chants the Lord's holy name with devotion?",

        "story": "Being defeated by the Visnudutas, the Yamad\u016btas approached Yamaraja in frustration. Because lord Yama didn't protect them while executing his orders to arrest Ajamila, they felt that there was no need to serve such a master. They even doubted whether he had the power to punish the sinful or if there were some authorities superior to him. They spoke to Yama, How many managers are there to punish sinful people? If multiple judges have multiple opinions on how to punish or reward people, there will be a lot of chaos and confusion! We thought you were the only punisher of all sinful human beings. But your order has been transgressed by four wonderful persons. They had cut our ropes when we were bringing sinful Aj\u0101mila to hell. When Ajamila chanted N\u0101r\u0101yana, these four men quickly came and saved him. Can you tell us who they are? Instead of being angry with his soldiers who spoke in a challenging spirit, Yamar\u0101ja was pleased to hear the holy name of Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana from them. Then, remembering his beloved Lord, he said My dear soldiers, Lord Visnu is the supreme. He is superior to me and all the devat\u0101s, including Brahm\u0101. He is the creator of everyone and everything in this universe. The four people you saw were His servants, the Visnud\u016btas. They are almost like the Lord, worshiped even by the devat\u0101s. Common people ver rarely see them. They protect the Lord's devotees from enencies and all difficulties. Yamar\u0101ja had explicitly described the good qualities of the Visnud\u016btas to convince his servants not to be envious of them. The Yamad\u016btas asked, If they protect the devotees, why are they favoring adharma by saving a sinful man like Ajamila? Yamar\u0101ja answered, No one can perfectly understand dharma except the mahajanas or pure devotees. The ultimate dharma of a living being is to perform devotional service unto the Lord. Bhakti begins by chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no need to search for proof. Ajamila is a direct example. Although sinful, Ajamila was liberated from the ropes of death just by chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101yana. Yamar\u0101ja continued, Those who perform bhakti unto Lord Visnu or Krsna or R\u0101ma or any other form of God are beyond my jurisdiction for punishment. Even if they sin, they are protected by chanting the Lord's holy name. So please never try to arrest devotees. They are constantly protected by the Lord's club called Kaumodaki. Therefore, Lord Brahm\u0101, I, and even the time factor cannot punish them. After thus cautioning the Yamad\u016btas, Yamar\u0101ja instructed them whom to bring to hell. He said, Bring to me for punishment, those who never worshiped Lord Krsna, never chanted His names or qualities, never remembered Him or bowed down to Him. Considering himself and his servants to be offenders, Yamar\u0101ja begged forgiveness from the Lord: O Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana, please forgive us. Because of our ignorance, we mistreated Your devotee Ajamila Since then, as soon as the Yamad\u016btas saw devotees of Lord Visnu or Krsna, they became fearful and didn't look at them again.",

After reading the three stories about Ajamila, what do you think people should do to avoid entering hell? 4. The chanting of God's names shall burn all sinful reactions. Does this entitle us to sin freely?",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON EMPATHY: Imagine you approach your elder brother when you are in some tension, and he scolds you further! Would you be comfortable? Empathy is an important aspect of relationships. Empathy means putting ourselves into another person's shoes and trying to recognize their feelings, and help them suitably. For example, when the Yamad\u016btas spoke to Yamaraja in a challenging tone, he first heard them patiently. He didn't chastise them or get offended. Instead, he explained things to them in loving manner. Similarly, when people approach us in frustration or disappointment, we should try to empathize with them, console them and help them as much as possible.",

        "title": "Eleven Thousand Sons",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 6",
        "story": "After Daksa was reborn as the son of the Pracetas, he went to the Vindhya mountains to worship Lord Visnu. With a desire to increase the population of the universe, he performed austerities (tapasya) for millions of years. Then Lord Visnu appeared before him on the back of His eternal carrier Garuda. Visnu looked very pleasing in His eight-handed form while holding His magnificent \u015bankha, cakra, gada and padma. Also, His charming smile on His divine face completely vanquished all miseries in one's heart. Daksa bowed down to Lord Visnu in respect. The Lord spoke, Dear Daksa, I know your desire. By My mercy, you will beget hundreds of children who will further increase the world's population with various types of species. Saying this, the Lord disappeared. Soon, Daksa married a woman named Asikn\u012b, and begot ten-thousand sons called the Harya\u015bvas. They were well-behaved and noble-hearted. Following the tradition, Daksa ordered them to go to the forest and perform austerities for purification, before taking on serious responsibilities as kings. The Harya\u015bvas then travelling towards the west, reached a beautiful lake called N\u0101r\u0101yana-saras. Great sages resided there, and in their association, they constantly worshipped Lord Visnu. Once, Narada Muni saw the Harya\u015bvas at N\u0101r\u0101yana-saras and felt, I should enlighten these young princes with spiritual knowledge, for they are pure-hearted and are qualified for liberation. So he approached them and spoke about the importance of spiritual life and the temporary nature of material life shortly and sweetly. Carefully thinking about N\u0101rada's words, the Harya\u015bvas collectively decided to dedicate their lives to the service of the Lord, rather than entering family life and politics. After offering their respects to N\u0101rada Muni for his teachings, they all turned into sanny\u0101s\u012bs. By sincere and dedicated worship of Lord Visnu, they eventually attained Vaikuntha. Daksa became upset when he heard how his ten-thousand sons became sanny\u0101s\u012bs. Lord Brahm\u0101 came to him and consoled him. Later Daksa begot another thousand sons named the Saval\u0101\u015bvas. As a dutiful father, he sent them also to N\u0101r\u0101yana-saras to perform austerities before getting married. The Saval\u0101\u015bvas went to N\u0101r\u0101yana-saras, and became purified by bathing in the holy waters and chanting the holy names of God. Once, N\u0101rada Muni approached them and spoke, You are all affectiona to your elder brothers. So, you should follow their path. N\u0101rack desired that the Savala\u015bvas will join the Harya\u015bvas in Vaikuntha After showering his merciful glances upon the young princes, Narada departed. The Saval\u0101\u015bvas decided to dedicate their life to the servic of Lord Visnu and thus became sanny\u0101s\u012bs just like the Harya\u015bvas. Daksa heard this and almost fainted. N\u0101rada Muni then thought, In the dynasty of Svayambhuva Manu \u2013 Priyavrata, Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, Dhruva, Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi, the Pracet\u0101s, Harya\u015bvas and Saval\u0101\u015bvas \u2013 all attained the Lord by my humble efforts. Why should only Daksa remain? I will help him also. Now that his sons have become sanny\u0101s\u012bs, Daksa must have developed detachment. So, this is a suitable time to give him mercy. If he does not come to me, I will go to his house. Thinking thus, Narada went to see Daksa. Although Narada Muni came with all good intentions, Dak\u015fa became furious. He strongly criticized him, saying, I am an honest householder, but you are a cheater in the dress of a sadhu. You have spoiled the minds of my young sons and made them sanny\u0101sis. You are heartless and sinful. You are surely not a devotee of Visnu. N\u0101rada remained silent. But Daksa continued, You may be forgiven once for influencing my first group of sons! But you have done the same thing to my second group of sons also. I cannot tolerate this. So, I curse you to keep traveling all over universe, without any fixed residence. Daksa thought that having no home was a punishment! But for a devotee like N\u0101rada, it is a boon, because he can travel everywhere and inspire many people in devotion to God. Though capable of cursing Daksa in return, N\u0101rada patiently tolerated and accepted the curse, thinking, Let him rebuke me. Then, when his anger subsides, he will regret for his misbehavior, and realize that I am tolerant. Then I can teach him about bhakti. But seeing Daksa reluctant, N\u0101rada Muni silently departed. Since Daksa had been offensive to Lord \u015aiva in his past life, he offended N\u0101rada now. N\u0101rada Muni continued to travel all over the universe to spread bhakti. But what did Daksa do? Did he beget any more children? How did he fulfill his desire to populate the universe? Read on to find the answers.",
        "quotes": "Any creation in this world takes place only with the blessings and sanction of the Lord., By the blessings and inspiration of a devotee, one can easily attain God., A compassionate devotee always looks forward to bringing people closer to God., Offense to one devotee can lead to offenses to multiple devotees.",
        "activity": "1. Do you think Narada is appropriate in making all of Dak\u00f1a's sons into devotees? Elaborate. 2. Was the response of Dak\u0148a unreasonable? Explain. 3. Daksha did tapasya for thousands of years and even saw Lord Vishnu. Still, he was offensive to Narada Muni. Can you explain why is it so? 4. Who is your source of inspiration? Why? What would you like to emulate from them?",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON INSPIRATION: The driving force that impels one into doing something is known as Inspiration. Don't you sometimes feel inspired to become a singer, a writer, a painter, or a dancer? Generally, that happens by seeing or hearing someone. Wise and kind persons like N\u00e4rada Muni try to utilize every opportunity to bring even offensive people to come closer to God. However, they only inspire people but not force them. Unless people are respectful and receptive, they cannot take benefit of a saint's mercy. Fortunate are those who take inspiration from wise devotees and advance in spiritual life (Dak\u015fa's sons), but foolish are those who misunderstand and criticize them (Dak\u015fa).",

        "story": "After Daksa's eleven thousand sons became sanny\u0101s\u012bs, he begot sixty beautiful daughters. They gave birth to various types of species in the universe: birds, serpents, aquatics, animals, demons, etc. Twenty-seven of the daughters of Daksa married the moon god. One of them, named Rohini, became the favorite wife of the moon, who started neglecting the remaining wives. This made Daksa angry, and he cursed the moon. Thus, the moon lost his shine and could not beget children also. Thereafter, he pacified Daksa and regained the light he had lost. Because of this curse, the moon loses his shining during the dark fortnight, and it manifests again during the bright fortnight. Among the remaining daughters of Daksa, ten daughters married lord Yama, seventeen married sage Ka\u015byapa and so on. Diti and Aditi were the prominent wives of Ka\u015byapa. Diti was the mother of the demons who are evil in their activities and attitude. Aditi was the mother of the devat\u0101s who are generally noble in their character. The devat\u0101s and demons often fight with each other due to their opposite natures. Once Indra was sitting on his great throne, surrounded by various categories of devat\u0101s in heaven. May singers and musicians praised him, as the heavenly damsels danced in joy. Over him was a white umbrella as effulgent as the full moon. He was served royalls while being fanned by yak-tail whisks. He became very puffed up by his opulence and position. At that time, Brhaspati, the guru of the devat\u0101s, came to that assembly. Indra did not rise from his seat to offer him respect or welcome him despite seeing him. Understanding that Indra was puffed up by his opulence, Brhaspati silently left the assembly. He didn't curse Indra, although capable of doing so. Indra immediately realized that he had offended his guru. Regretting his grave mistake, he spoke, Alas, I am so foolish to have committed such a great offense due to my pride! I failed to respect my guru. Now I will go and bow down at his feet. Although Indra searched for B\u1e5bhaspati everywhere with the assistance of the devat\u0101s, he couldn't find him. To teach a lesson to Indra, B\u1e5bhaspati had disappeared by his great power. Indra lost his peace. Hearing of Indra's pitiable condition, the demons declared war against the devat\u0101s. Their guru \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya guided them to attack the devat\u0101s. Soon the demons heavily injured the devat\u0101s and chased them away from heaven. Then, they occupied the heaven and enjoyed all its comforts. The distressed devat\u0101s approached Lord Brahma with bowed heads, seeking shelter and guidance. Brahma scolded them for their misbehavior. He admonished them saying, Due to the madness of your wealth and position, you failed to receive your guru Brhaspati properly. He is a virtuous br\u0101hmana with great spiritual knowledge. Due to your offenses, you who are so strong have been defeated by the weak demons, who have been defeated by you several times before. The demons gained great strength by worshipping their guru. If you respect brahmanas, cows and Lord Govinda, there will be no misfortune; but if you disrespect them, there will be great misfortune. Brahma then instructed the devat\u0101s, Now you all should accept Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa as your guru. His father Tvast\u0101 is a powerful br\u0101hma\u1e47a while his mother Racan\u0101 is the daughter of demons. So, Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa will help you regain your kingdom. But because he is related to the demons through his mother, he can show some affection for them too. So you have to tolerate that. Thus, Lord Brahm\u0101 guided Indra and the other devat\u0101s in their difficulty. Did Brahm\u0101's solution work? How did Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa respond to the request of the devat\u0101s?

As soon as a student sees the teacher, the student must acknowledge the teacher's presence by standing up, greeting and bowing down. With such a culture of respect, one receives blessings. The satisfaction of guru is the source of great strength in life. Conversely, dissatisfaction of guru makes one weak. By disrespecting their guru, the strong devat\u0101s became weaker than the demons. And by respecting their guru, the weak demons become stronger than the devat\u0101s. So let's cultivate the right etiquette towards all elders.",

        "story": "After hearing the advice of Brahm\u0101, the devat\u0101s were somewhat relieved of their anxiety. They all went to Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa, the powerful br\u0101hmana with three heads. Embracing him they said, Dear Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa, may there be all good fortune for you. Although you are younger than us, we offer our obeisances to you, because you are advanced in mantras. We accept you as our guru because you are a perfect br\u0101hma\u0146a, and by your power we will easily defeat our enemies. Please mercifully relieve our distress. The demons took away our positions. Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa was pleased and replied, Dear devat\u0101s, I agree to be your priest. I can't refuse even a small request from you because you are the commanders of the universe. After making this promise, liberal Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa taught Indra a secret protective prayer called N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-kavaca as follows. Protection by chanting mantras: Chant the eight-syllable mantra - 'om namo n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101ya' - chant one syllable of this mantra on the following limbs in order: feet, knees, thighs, belly, heart, chest, mouth, and head. Then chant the twelve-syllable mantra - om namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya - place the syllables of this mantra on the tips of the fingers, from right index finger to left index finger, place the remaining four syllables on the joints of the two thumbs. Then chant the six-syllable mantra - om vi\u015fnave namah - place the syllable om on the heart; vi on the top of the head; sa between the eyebrows; na on the \u015bikh\u0101; ve between the eyes; na on all the joints of the body and meditate on the syllable ma as being a weapon. Thus, the mantras will become protective armors in all directions. Protection by different avataras: May Lord Visnu on the back of Garuda, whose eight hands hold the conch, disk, sword, shield, club, arrow, bow and noose, protect me on all sides. May Matsya avatara (the Fish incarnation) protect me in water from fierce animals. May Lord Vamana (the dwarf-br\u0101hmana incarnation) protect me on the land. May Lord Nrsimhadeva (the half-man half-lion incarnation) protect me in difficult places like the forests and battlefield. May Lord Varaha (the Boar incarnation) save me on the streets. May Lord Kurma (the Tortoise incarnation) save me from falling to hell. May Lord Ramacandra protect me in the foreign countries. May Lord Dhanvantari protect me from unhealthy eatables and physical illness. May Lord R\u1e63abhadeva save me from all fears. May Lord Balarama protect me from injuries caused by others. May Lord Sesa from envious serpents. May Vy\u0101sadeva protect me from ignorance. May Lord Buddha save me from activities opposed to the Vedas and laziness. May Lord Kalki protect me from the dirt of Kaliyuga. Protection by the Lord's weapons: May the Lord's disc (Sudar\u015bana cakra) burn all our enemies to ashes. May His Club (Gad\u0101) help me pound to pieces all the evil beings like the ghosts and demons. May Lord Krsna's conch (P\u0101\u00f1cajanya) filled with His air creates fearful sound vibrations and cause trembling in the hearts of enemies. May the Lord's sword cut the soldiers of my enemies to pieces. May His shield marked with a hundred brilliant moonlike circles cover the eyes of the sinful enemies and pluck out their sinful eyes. Holy name: May the Lord's name protect us from the influence of bad planets, meteors, envious people, serpents, scorpions, ferocious animals, ghosts and sins. May Garuda protect us from all dangers. Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa concluded, Dear Indra, by employing this N\u0101r\u0101yana-kavaca prayer, you will be able to conquer the demons easily and will be saved from all dangers. By the power of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-kavaca, Indra conquered the demons, and again became the ruler of heaven. Did Indra live happily ever after? Or did the demons make a stronger comeback?

        "story": "One day, Indra saw Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa performing a sacrifice in which he was visibly offering oblations to the devat\u0101s, and secretly to the demons as well. It was because his mother came from the family of demons Indra noticed this and thought that Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa was cheating him. Feeling very insecure that the demons would become strong again, Indra angrily cut off Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa's three heads. Those heads became three types of birds. Indra had committed a grave sin by killing a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who had acted as his guru and helped him regain his position. Thus Indra suffered the sinful reaction for one year, and repented for his misdeed. Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa's father Tvast\u0101 became very upset with Indra for killing his son. To take revenge on Indra, he performed a sacrifice to get a son who could kill Indra. However, because of improper pronunciation of mantras, he got a son who would be killed by Indra. From Tvast\u0101's sacrificial fire appeared a fearful demon who looked like the destroyer of the entire creation. He was tall, blackish, gigantic, and lustrous, with a coppery hair, beard, and moustache. His eyes were burning red, and he held a blazing trident. He shouted in a loud voice, and made the earth tremble as if from an earthquake. As he yawned, he seemed to swallow the sky with his cave-like mouth. He seemed to be licking up the stars with his tongue and eating the entire universe with his long, sharp teeth. Seeing this gigantic demon everyone ran in all directions in great fear. Because he covered all the planets, he was named Vrtr\u0101sura (one who covers everything). Although a demon, Vrtr\u00e4sura was considered a brahmana because he was the son of Tvasta who did sacrifice to beget him. And Tvasta's son Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa was Vrtr\u00e4sura's brother. Now Vrtr\u00e4sura's mission was to attack Indra who had killed his brother Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa impulsively. Vrtr\u00e4sura immediately left the sacrificial arena to fight with the devat\u0101s. The devat\u0101s attacked Vrtr\u0101sura, striking him with heavenly bows and arrows and other weapons, but Vrtr\u0101sura swallowed all their weapons. Struck with wonder and disappointment, the devat\u0101s ran away for the shelter of Lord Visnu. They prayed, O Lord, You have protected us earlier in many incarnations (avat\u0101ras). You appeared among the devat\u0101s as Lord V\u0101mana, among the sages as Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma, among the animals as Varaha, among the aquatics as Matsya and K\u00fcrma, and among men as R\u0101ma and Krsna. Now please appear in some form and save us from this fearful demon Vrtr\u0101sura. In response to their appeal, Lord Visnu appeared in front of them. Seeing Him, the devat\u0101s fell at His feet like rods, and said, O supremely merciful Lord! You are the sole proprietor of the entire universe. You have always appeared in various incarnations to punish the demons. Please appear today as another incarnation to kill Vrtr\u0101sura. He has swallowed all our weapons, and strength. Hearing the prayers of the devat\u0101s, Lord Visnu replied, Dear devat\u0101s, pure devotees only aspire to serve Me selflessly, without any material desires. But since you have approached Me for protection from a demon, I shall suggest you a way to come out of this danger. What was the advice of Visnu to the devat\u0101s? Did his solution help them kill Vrtr\u0101sura? Read the next story to know!",

Although they sometimes manifest poor attitudes and behaviors, they are obedient servants of Lord Vi\u015f\u0146u. So, the Lord always supports them in difficulties, and shows them how to come out of dangers. Similarly, when we see youngsters commit some small mistakes sometimes, we shouldn't ignore the persons, but try to extend our support and help them overcome their shortcomings.",

        "story": "Seeing the devat\u0101s fearful of Vrtrasura and seeking some solution, Lord Visnu advised them, You all should immediately approach sage Dadhici, who is My great devotee. His body is very powerful because of his great spiritual knowledge and activities. Earlier, he taught spiritual science to the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras, the heavenly doctors. Once, the A\u015bvini-kum\u0101ras approached Dadhici Muni and begged him to teach spiritual science. Dadh\u012bci replied, Now I am busy with some sacrifices. Please come after some time. The A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras then left. Thereafter, Indra approached Dadhici and said,My dear Muni, the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras are just doctors. Please do not instruct them in spiritual science. If you do so, I shall cut off your head. After warning Dadh\u012bci in this way, Indra returned to heaven. The A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras knew Indra's mind, yet they again approached Dadh\u012bci for spiritual knowledge. When Dadh\u012bci informed them of Indra's threat, they said, Dear sage, first we will cut off your head and replace it with a horse's head, through which you can teach us. When Indra comes and cuts off that head, we shall restore your original head. Dadh\u012bci considered that he had already promised the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras, so he agreed to their proposal, and gave them divine spiritual teachings through the mouth of a horse. Such was his selfless nature. Continuing to praise Dadhici in front of the devat\u0101s, Lord Vi\u015fnu said, It was Dadhici who taught the Narayana-kavaca to Tvast\u0101, who then taught it to Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa. Later Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa taught it to Indra, who thus conquered the demons and regained heaven. Now you all ask Dadhici for his bones. He will give them to you if the Asvini-kumaras request him. Then, the heavenly architect Vi\u015bvakarma will prepare a thunderbolt (vajra) weapon from his bones. This thunderbolt will certainly kill Vrtr\u00e4sura. Vrtr\u0101sura is also My devotee and will not harm you. Do not worry. Having thus instructed the devat\u0101s, Lord Vi\u015fnu disappeared. Following the advice of Lord Visnu, all the devat\u0101s approached Dadhici and begged for his bones. Dadh\u012bci smiled and jokingly said, Don't you know about the unbearable pain of death? The body is very dear to every living being. One has to protect it by all means. How can one give it up, even if demanded by Lord Visnu? The devat\u0101s replied, O great sage, you can understand others' difficulties, because you are compassionate. Selfish people don't understand the pain of others. If the rich knew the beggar's pain, they would not refuse to give charity. So, what is difficult to give up for merciful people like you? Dadh\u012bci Muni replied, Dear devat\u0101s, I refused to offer my body, just to hear from you about dharma. Otherwise, I have no objection. I shall happily give it for your service as advised by Lord Visnu. Anyways, I will have to leave this temporary body one day. It may die at any moment. Using it for the welfare of others is the right utility of this body. One who has no compassion for suffering people, and does not use one's body for others' welfare, is pitiable. Dadh\u012bci then gave up his body while meditating on his beloved Lord Visnu. In a deep trance, he did not even realize that he was dying The devat\u0101s took away the bones from his body, and gave them to Vi\u015bvakarm\u0101, to make a thunderbolt (vajra) weapon from them. When Vi\u015bvakarm\u0101 made the invincible thunderbolt, charged with Dadhici's power, Indra took it up. Riding on his elephant carrier Air\u0101vata, surrounded by thousands of devat\u0101s, Indra went to attack Vrtr\u0101sura. Vrtr\u0101sura was accompanied by powerful demon warriors. A fierce battle took place between the devat\u0101s and the demons on the bank of the Narmad\u0101 River. Who won in the battle? Was Indra able to kill Vrtr\u0101sura with the vajra?

Such selfless service - (i) pleases the Lord, (ii) satisfies ourselves, and (iii) helps develop loving relationships. Compassionate people serve others even at the cost of personal inconvenience.

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 6",
        "story": "The demons attacked the devat\u0101s with mountain peaks, tridents, axes, swords and other deadly weapons. The devat\u0101s were covered by arrows like the stars are covered by dense clouds, but they quickly slashed those lethal weapons to pieces before they even reached them. The demons became afraid when they saw that the soldiers of King Indra were not at all injured by their weapons. Scared for their lives, they left their leader Vrtr\u0101sura even at the beginning of the fight, and ran away from the battlefield. Vrtr\u0101sura spoke some wise words to motivate the fleeing demons, O Vipracitti! O Namuci! O Pulom\u0101! O Maya and \u015aambara! Please hear me. If one dies on the battlefield by fighting the enemies without showing one's one's back, one will be promoted to higher planets. So don't run away. Fight! However, the demons were too fearful. They didn't pay heed to their commander's words, and started running away from the devat\u0101s. Taking advantage of their fear, the devat\u0101s chased them and attacked them from rear. Vrtr\u0101sura then chastised the devat\u0101s, Attacking the demons is useless. What is the benefit of killing enemies from behind if they are fleeing in fear? It is a shame on you. If you are courageous, stand before me for a moment on the battlefield. Angry Vrtr\u00e4sura terrified the devat\u0101s. When he roared with an enormous voice, resembling a lion, the devat\u0101s fainted as if struck by thunderbolts. As the devatas closed their eyes in fear, Vrtr\u00e4sura, taking up his trident and making the earth tremble, trampled the devat\u0101s like a mad elephant tramples hollow bamboos. Seeing Vrtr\u0101sura, Indra became intolerant and threw a great club at him, but Vrtr\u0101sura easily caught it with his left hand. Then, Vrtr\u00e4sura angrily struck Air\u0101vata's head with the same club and roared loudly. For this heroic deed, the soldiers on both sides glorified him. Spitting blood from its broken mouth, Air\u0101vata was pushed back fourteen yards along with Indra. Seeing the condition of Airavata and despondent Indra, Vrtr\u0101sura didn't further strike Indra. Indra relieved Airavata with his nectar-producing hand and gained composure. Remembering Indra's sinful acts, Vrtr\u0101sura spoke, O abominable one! You acted like a butcher by mercilessly severing the three heads of my brother Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa. He was a sinless br\u0101hma\u0146a and your guru. You have no shame and mercy. I will clear my debt to my brother by piercing your stone-like heart with my trident. When I kill you, only vultures will eat your body. If the other devat\u0101s attack me, I shall sever their heads too. Indra became ashamed of hearing these words. Vrtr\u0101sura instructed Indra, But if you kill me in this fight, I will go to Vaikuntha. Why don't you hurl your thunderbolt weapon at me? Indra thought, Vrtr\u0101sura is cheating me. Just as he made my club useless, he will make the thunderbolt useless by his powers, and again attack me. To reassure him, Vrtr\u0101sura said, Your victory is assured. The thunderbolt has been empowered by Lord Visnu's blessings and Dadhici's austerities. You can kill me with it. When Visnu favors a person, victory, opulence, and good qualities are assured. By that thunderbolt, I will be freed from this world and attain Lord Sankar\u015fana in Vaikuntha. Material heaven is of no use for the Lord's devotees. Seeing that Indra did not throw the thunderbolt, Vrtr\u0101sura thought, What is the use of speaking to this rascal Indra who sees everything materially? I better pray to my Lord.

In this story, we see that Vrtr\u00e4sura's faith in Lord Vi\u015fnu's words is more than that of Indra. That faith makes demon Vrtr\u00e4sura a better devotee than devat\u0101 Indra.",

        "story": "Seeing Indra not ready to fight, Vrtr\u0101sura meditated on Lord Visnu. He prayed, O Lord, may my mind always think of You. May my words always praise Your divine qualities. May my body always engage in Your loving service. I do not desire heavenly enjoyment, mystic powers or liberation. All I need is Your service. May I become a servant of Your wonderful servants. Expressing his longing to reach the Lord, Vrtr\u0101sura implored, Just as baby birds are dependent on the mother bird to feed them, just as hungry calves wait to drink the milk of their mother cows, and just as a wife lovingly waits for her husband to return home, I always yearn for the opportunity to serve You directly! Please give me the friendship of Your wonderful devotees. Let my mind not be attached to anything in this temporary world. Vrtr\u0101sura then thought, Indra would become agitated and fight again, if I show my prowess. So, Vrtr\u0101sura whirled his trident and threw it at Indra exclaiming loudly, O evil one, now I shall finish you off! Indra cut that blazing trident to pieces with his thunderbolt and also cut off the right arm of Vrtr\u0101sura ruthlessly. Vrtr\u00e4sura then angrily struck Indra on the jaw with an iron mace. He also struck Air\u0101vata. Then the thunderbolt weapon slipped from Indra's hand and fell to the ground. The devat\u0101s praised Vrtr\u0101sura's deed, but seeing Indra in danger, and they lamented, Alas! Alas! Having been practically defeated, Indra felt ashamed to pick up his thunderbolt again. Vrtr\u0101sura encouraged Indra, Take up your thunderbolt and kill your enemy. This is not the time for lamentation. Only Lord Visnu is always victorious. All others are sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated. Time is the cause of victory or defeat. Therefore, one should be equipoised in all the disturbing circumstances in life. Look at me! Even my arm is cut, I am still trying my best to fight, without being discouraged. Hearing Vrtr\u0101sura's insightful words, Indra was surprised and thought, How can a demon possess such devotion, wisdom and detachment? Then he recollected how Prahlada, Bali and others who were born as demons but were very wise and devotional. So he felt that Vrtr\u0101sura was like them. Indra took up his thunderbolt again, and praised Vrtr\u0101sura: You are a perfect devotee. I can see your composure, wisdom and devotion despite your dangerous position. Thus, Vrtr\u0101sura and Indra, both powerful fighters, spoke about bhakti even on the battlefield, and again began fighting dutifully. Vrtr\u00e4sura then threw his iron club at Indra with his left hand. Indra smashed it with his thunderbolt, and cut Vrtr\u0101sura's left hand too. With his both hands lost, Vrtr\u0101sura was bleeding profusely. Even in his weak state, he seemed to devour the entire universe. His gigantic form seemed that his lower jaw was on the ground, and his upper jaw in the sky. His mouth was deep like the sky, and his tongue was like a large serpent. He shook the mountains, crushing the earth's surface, as if he were the Himalayas walking about. Gaining his composure, Vrtr\u0101sura came before Indra and swallowed him along with Air\u0101vata, just as a gigantic python might swallow an elephant. Seeing this, the devat\u0101s and sages became surprised. Then Vrtr\u0101sura reflected, Now I have killed Indra. There is no need to fight any more. Let me meditate on the Lord. He thus went into a trance. The living spark (soul) then came out of Vrtr\u0101sura's body and joyfully entered Vaikuntha. Thus, he became an associate of Lord Sankarsana, a divine form of Lord Visnu in the spiritual world. Although swallowed by Vrtr\u0101sura, Indra didn't die within his belly, because he was protected by the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u0146a-kavaca. Instead, Indra came out of Vrtr\u0101sura's abdomen by piercing it with his thunderbolt. Then he cut off Vrtr\u0101sura's head with the thunderbolt. It took one year for him to do so. All the devat\u0101s celebrated Indra's victory, and showered flowers upon him in joy. But Indra wasn't happy. He was extremely sad despite being victorious. Read the next story to find out the reason.",

It could be an exam, or an accident or some misunderstanding with a relative we tend to get confused and overwhelmed. But great people maintain steadiness in all situations. In this story, the demons on the side of Vrtr\u00e4sura left him. But instead of being discouraged, he fought alone. He even motivated Indra to perform his duty. He didn't misunderstand Lord Visnu, who arranged for his death through the thunderbolt. Thus, he showed great steadiness in his duty and devotion. Such steadiness in difficult situations comes from the blessings of devotees and deep faith in the Lord. Let's cultivate it and pray for it.",

        "story": "When Vrtr\u0101sura was killed, all the devat\u0101s felt relieved and returned to their homes peacefully. While departing, no one spoke anything to Indra. Indra was very dejected. He was mentally disturbed after killing Vrtr\u0101sura, who was a br\u0101hma\u0146a and a devotee of Lord Visnu. During the war, Indra was hesitant to kill Vrtr\u0101sura, whom he found very exalted. But the devat\u0101s and the sages encouraged him to do so. Then Indra asked them, Previously, I foolishly killed Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa and received a terrible sinful reaction, but somehow I was relieved from it. But now, if I kill Vrtr\u0101sura, another noble br\u0101hma\u0146a, how shall I free myself from the sin? The sages told Indra, We shall perform an a\u015bvamedha yaj\u00f1a to release you from any sin you may accrue by killing the br\u0101hma\u0146a. Do not fear. Thus, encouraged by the sages, Indra had killed Vrtr\u0101sura, hoping that the yaj\u00f1a would relieve him from sins. Soon, the sinful reaction to killing a brahmana approached Indra. It took the form of a witch afflicted with tuberculosis. Her body was covered with filthy blood. Her head was covered with scattered grey hair. Her unbearable foul breath polluted the surroundings. She called Indra, Wait! Wait! and followed him wherever he went - in the sky and in all directions. At last, Indra went to the northeast and entered a lake called Manasa-sarovara. Indra lived invisibly in that lake for a thousand years always thinking of how he could be relieved from his sinful reaction. Finally, he stayed in the subtle fibers of a lotus stem, practically starving. In the absence of Indra, the devat\u0101s needed a king for the heaven. So, they approached a powerful king on the earth named Nahusa to rule the heaven. Nahusa had great knowledge and mystic powers. He agreed to take up the position, but became very proud of it. Once, Nahusa asked Indra's wife, Now I am in the position of Indra. Therefore, you should serve me. Surprised at this unreasonable proposal, Indra's wife reported this to Brhaspati, the guru of the devat\u0101s. Then Brhaspati advised her, Tell Nahusa that you will serve him if he comes in a palanquin carried by br\u0101hmanas. She then informed Nahusa of the same. Thereafter, Nahusa ordered the sages including Agastya Muni to carry his palanquin. While the sages were carrying him, Nahusa arrogantly said, sarpa, sarpa, meaning Go quickly, go quickly. He even haughtily touched Agastya Muni with his foot. Agastya became angry and cursed Nahusa, O impudent king, you are so proud and disrespectful to the br\u0101hmanas. May you become a sarpa (snake)! Thus, handsome and powerful Nahusa fell from his position and became an ugly python. Meanwhile, Indra, who was living in the Manasa-sarovara, repented for his sins by sitting in the lotus stem for a long time. Further, by the influence of Lord \u015aiva, Indra became further purified. And Mother Laksmi, who resides in the lotus, also gave protection to him. By meditating on Lord Visnu, Indra was ultimately relieved of all sins. Then he was called back to heaven by the br\u0101hma\u0146as. Later Indra performed an a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1a and became relieved of all his sins. Thus, he was honored by everyone again. While reading the story, did you wonder how the king of devat\u0101s could get such a grave sinful reaction by killing a demon? Also, how could Vrtr\u0101sura develop such great devotion to Lord Visnu? Turn on to the next story to find your answers.",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON PRIDE: Would you be comfortable dealing with a person who is too proud? May be not, isn't it? Of all the bad qualities that a person can have, pride is one of the most degrading one. Nahusa, a human king on the earth, became the king of heaven because of his good qualities, but his pride made him a python! One may be very beautiful, educated, wealthy, popular and successful, but pride nullifies them. Proud people cannot accept others' greatness or understand others' pain. They tend to disrespect, mistreat and look down upon others. So, let us be extremely careful not to be proud. The opposite quality of pride is humility. We can save ourselves from pride by humbly transferring the credit for our success to all those who have helped us in life, and by respecting everyone appropriately.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 6",
        "story": "In his previous life, Vrtr\u0101sura was a great king named Citraketu, who ruled the \u015a\u016brasena province. He was handsome, educated, wealthy and kind. During his reign, the earth was prosperous in all ways. He married a beautiful queen named Krtadyuti, but he had no children. Then he married another wife, but still he didn't get a child. He desired a good successor who could take charge of the kingdom after his retirement. But he remained childless even after marrying ten million wives, due to his destiny. This filled his mind with anxiety. His wealth, beautiful queens and control over all lands didn't give him any happiness. Once, a powerful sage named Angir\u0101, travelling all over the world, came to the palace of King Citraketu. Citraketu received him with great respect and bowed down to his feet. Being pleased with the hospitality, Angir\u0101 spoke, Dear Citraketu, is everything well? Are your wives, citizens, ministers, and servants cooperating with you? I see that your mind is not pleased. Your pale face reflects your anxiety. Citraketu bent his head and replied, What is unknown to perfect yog\u012bs like yourself! Yet, because you asked me, let me disclose to you the cause for my anxiety. My prosperous kingdom doesn't please me, because I do not have a child. Please help me get a son. Merciful Angir\u0101 wanted to help Citraketu. He performed a sacrifice for him to get a son. He gave the pras\u0101dam (divine food) offered in the yaj\u00f1a to Krtadyuti, the first and most perfect among Citraketu's millions of queens. Then Angira departed after warning Citraketu, You will have a son, who will cause you both happiness and sorrow. Citraketu understood Angira's words in this way: My son's birth will certainly cause happiness. But, because he will be my only son, he will probably be proud of his great wealth and empire, and may not be very obedient. Thus, he might cause distress. But that is alright. Eventually, Krtadyuti gave birth to a beautiful son. Hearing this news, all the citizens were extremely pleased. Citraketu's happiness knew no bounds. First, he requested expert br\u0101hma\u0146as to perform the birth ceremony for the new born baby. Then, like a cloud pours rain, he generously gave charity of gold, silver, garments, ornaments, villages, cows, and so on to receive blessings for his son. Citraketu's affection for his son increased daily. However, he spent most of his time with the boy and Krtadyuti, and neglected his other queens. This made them extremely unhappy. Feeling ignored by their husband, they desired to have children like the first queen. They all thought, If only we had children, we wouldn't be neglected by our husband. Even maidservants get respect from the husband, but childless wives are most unfortunate. The co-wives of Krtadyuti became envious of her fortune. They lost their intelligence, became hard-hearted and very intolerant. Considering the child to be the cause of their current situation, they gave him poison and killed him. Envy makes one hard-hearted, lose all common sense and take to destructive action. Unaware of the sinful act of her co-wives, Krtadyuti thought that her son had been sleeping for a long time. Later, she sent her maid to wake him up, only to realize that the child was dead. Shocked at seeing the lifeless boy, she cried profusely and fell to the ground unconscious. All the palace residents gathered there and began to cry. The queens who had given the poison also cried pretentiously. How did Citraketu react to his son's untimely death? What happened to his wives who poisoned the child? Read the next story to discover.",

We cannot decide the place of our birth, color of our bodies, gender, etc. But we do have the independence to make some choices in life. So, we need to focus on what is within our control, and accept things that are beyond our control the way they happen. God is watching all of us and shall certainly bestow what we deserve. But this shouldn't make us lazy. We should responsibly work towards our realistic goals, leaving the results in God's hands. We should know our practical limitations and shouldn't hanker for things that are too difficult or impossible to attain. That only wastes our time, which could have been productively used in self-improvement and God's service.",

        "title": "The Dead Comes to Life!",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 6",
        "story": "This news of the child's death reached King Citraketu, who came to the spot in great haste. His sorrow grew like a blazing fire. He became almost blind. Slipping and falling, he approached the dead child and fell unconscious at his feet, with his hair and dress scattered. Regaining consciousness, his eyes were tearful, and he could not speak. Seeing her husband's lamentation and the dead child, Krtadyuti blamed God, Alas, O Supreme knower, You are so foolish, for You have caused the death of his son while the father is still living. You have created strong bonds of affection and have broken them abruptly. What is the need for such a God? Krtadyuti then turning to her child's dead body, spoke, My dear son, please get up and drink my milk. Just look at your sad father. We are completely dejected by your absence. Please get up from your long sleep, your playmates are calling you. I am very unfortunate, for I can no longer see your charming smile, joyful eyes, lotus face and hear your pleasing voice. You have closed your eyes forever. As she piteously cried, the entire palace and kingdom of Citraketu were immersed in sadness. When Citraketu lay like a dead body next to his son's dead body, N\u0101rada Muni and Angir\u0101 Muni spoke to him, Dear Citraketu, what relationship does this dead body have with you? Did this relationship exist before? Does it truly exist now? Will it continue in the future? Citraketu was confused to hear such questions. In deep grief he couldn't reply. Narada Muni said, As sand particles on a seashore come together and get separated by the force of waves, the living beings also sometimes come together and are separated by the force of time. We were not together before birth and will not be together after death. God brings people together and disperses them as they deserve. King Citraketu understood the philosophy verbally, but couldn't digest it heartily. The sages explained further, As from one seed another seed is generated, so from the parents' bodies, a child's body is generated. But the soul is not created by the parents. The body of the child is right in front of you! And you have never seen the eternal soul within the body. Whom are you lamenting for? Citraketu became enlightened by these timely teachings of the sages. Wiping his face with his hand, he said, O wise br\u0101hma\u0146as, you travel on earth just to educate ignorant people like me. So, please enlighten me with your spiritual teachings. Then sage Angir\u0101 spoke, Dear king, we have come to relieve you from your sadness. Learned devotees never lament for material loss or gain. Earlier when I met you, you were overwhelmed with the desire to have a son. So I fulfilled your desire. Now that you have understood the temporary nature of material relationships, you are ready for spiritual knowledge. Narada Muni then spoke to Citraketu, I shall give you a very auspicious mantra. By receiving it, you will be able to see Lord Sankar\u015fa\u0146a face to face just in seven nights. Even Lord Siva and other great devat\u0101s took shelter of Lord Sankarsana with this mantra. N\u0101rada Muni then brought the dead son alive with his mystic power and said, Dear child, just see your father and mother. Everyone is sad because of your passing away. Re-enter your body and enjoy life with your relatives. Accept your father's royal throne and wealth. The boy spoke, O great sage, in which birth were these persons my parents? I have been wandering in the bodies of devat\u0101s, animals, and human beings. In many lifetimes, I had many parents from different species. In different births people become our friends, relatives, enemies, well-wishers and so on. All these relationships are valid only when one is within a body. But no one is permanently related. Saying this, the boy again left, and people saw only his dead body. Citraketu and all others were astonished on hearing the bitter facts of life taught by the child. Giving up their sadness, they dutifully arranged for the funeral ceremony of the dead boy, as a matter of custom. Krtadyuti's co-wives were ashamed of their sinful act. They atoned for the killing of the child on the bank of the Yamuna River as directed by br\u0101hma\u0146as. There after, Citraketu chanted the mantra given by Narada Muni continuously for one week His mind thus became increasingly attached to Lord Sankarsana, who was pleased to appear in front of him. The Lord's complexion was whitish. He was dressed in bluish garments, and was adorned with a dazzling crown and other ornaments. Seeing the Lord, Citraketu offered Him prayers. The Lord blessed him and said, By the instructions of Narada and Angira, you have gained spiritual knowledge and are able to see Me. Human Birth is very rare, and must be utilized properly. Its ultimate goal is to perform bhakti-yoga and understand Me. O King, you will achieve Me at the end of life. Saying this, the Lord departed as Citraketu looked on. By the mercy of the Lord, Citraketu became the ruler of the Vidyadhara planet. The story doesn't end here! There was an unexpected difficulty in Citraketu's life when he encountered Lord \u015aiva. He became a demon! To know how, turn on to the next chapter!",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 6",
        "story": "Once King Citraketu was traveling in outer space on a celestial airplane given to him by the Lord Himself. He was surrounded by many women who are singing about Lord Visnu with devotion. While thus traveling, he saw Lord \u015aiva in an assembly of many sages, with P\u0101rvat\u012b sitting on his lap. Seeing this, Citraketu laughed loudly and spoke in front of everyone, Lord \u015aiva is everyone's guru and a great speaker of dharma. Yet, he is publicly sitting with his wife on his lap, as if he were a shameless man! Even ordinary people embrace their wives in solitary places. How surprising it is that he is doing so in an assembly of saints! Citraketu didn't mean to insult Lord \u015aiva like Daksa did. He certainly had great respect for \u015aiva. But he was concerned that when common people see Lord \u015aiva sitting with Parvati on his lap, they might misunderstand and criticize him. He didn't want exalted \u015aiva to have such infamy. Knowing Citraketu's mind, Lord \u015aiva smiled and mained silent. The sages and br\u0101hma\u0146as sitting there also did not Speak. Although Citraketu had a genuine concern, he was somewhat proud of his attaining the mercy of Lord Sankarsana. Hence, he fearlessly commented on Lord \u015aiva, which Mother P\u0101rvati didn't appreciate. She was very upset with his bold behavior. Mother Parvati angrily spoke, Has this upstart been appointed as the punisher of shameless persons like us? It seems Brahm\u0101, N\u0101rada, Manu and Kapila have all forgotten dharma, as they did not stop Lord \u015aiva's so called improper behavior! This person who proudly insulted \u015aiva doesn't deserve the shelter of Lord Visnu. He is puffed up, thinking himself a great devotee. O arrogant Citraketu, may you become a demon so that you will not commit such an offence again towards great personalities. Citraketu then came down from his airplane, bowed down before P\u00e4rvat\u012b with great humility, and pleasingly spoke, O mother, I accept your curse. I don't blame anyone for this incident, because happiness and distress are results one's own deeds. In this material world, what is a curse and what is a blessing? What is heaven and what is hell? None of these have a permanent effect. Please forgive me for my improper speech. Saying this, Citraketu left in his airplane as everyone looked on in astonishment. Then \u015aiva spoke to P\u0101rvat\u012b, O P\u0101rvat\u012b! You angrily cursed Citraketu, but he didn't become angry or curse you in return. Instead, he was composed, and respectfully addressed you as a mother. That means your curse didn't have any effect on him. Such devotees never fear any condition of life. For them heaven, hell or liberation are all the same. They are interested only in the service of Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana. Both Citraketu and I are very dear to the Lord Sankarsana. Sometimes he jokes with me, and sometimes I joke with him. Hearing Lord \u015aiva's words, P\u0101rvati felt ashamed for cursing Citraketu. Because of Parvati's curse, Citraketu became Vrtr\u0101sura, the great demon who terrorized all the devat\u0101s, and was finally killed by Indra's thunderbolt. In fact, P\u0101rvat\u012b's curse was a boon for Citraketu. Because, after taking birth as the demon V\u1e5btr\u0101sura and dutifully fighting with Indra, he immediately went to Vaikuntha. Being born as Vrtr\u0101sura increased his love for the Lord. Lord Visnu wanted Citraketu to come to Vaikuntha as soon possible. So, out of affection, He inspired Mother Parvati to curse Citraketu. In this way, he showed us that a devotee is unaffected by curses and blessings.",
        "quotes": "Even if there is some apparent fault in the activities of an exalted person, one shouldn't correct them., A mother's punishment for a misbehaving son is out of her natural affection., Tolerance is one of the primary qualities of a devotee., Whether a devotee is born in the body of a devata or a demon or an animal, it doesn't matter.",
        "activity": "1. Do you think Citraketu's remark was inappropriate? Why? 2. What should we do when elders chastise us without understanding our intentions? 3. What would you do when someone comments on you publicly?",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON RESPECT: Would you feel comfortable when someone criticizes you publicly? Public disrespect is painful, especially when a younger person does it. Just as we expect others to deal with us respectfully, we ought to treat them respectfully. Especially when we are dealing with elders, Including parents and teachers, we need to be very respectful. Even if we happen to see some faults in them, we shouldn't criticize them arrogantly, considering their age and experience. If we disagree with their decisions or actions, we may express it respectfully and privately without demeaning them. Such a culture of respecting elders shall please the Lord.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 6",
        "story": "Once Diti, the mother of the demons, became very upset with Indra. She thought, To favor Indra, Lord Visnu had killed my two sons Hirany\u0101ksa and Hiranyaka\u015bipu, in the forms of Lord Var\u0101ha and Lord Narasimha respectively. Hardhearted Indra is the cause of my sons' death. Only when sinful Indra is killed, I can rest in peace. I wish to have a son who can kill him. Hirany\u0101ksa and Hiranyaka\u015bipu were cruel demons, who had tormented the devat\u0101s, sages and innocent people. So, the punishment they received was appropriate. Still, Diti envied Indra and desired his death. To fulfil her wicked desire, Diti constantly served her husband Ka\u015byapa Muni with her sweet and charming words, and tried to impress him. Though learned, Ka\u015byapa was pleased by her artificial behavior and assured her, My dear Diti, I am very happy with your service. You can ask for any boon from me. Hearing her husband's promise, Diti became joyful and expressed her desire, My only desire is to get an immortal son who can kill cruel Indra, who was the cause of my sons' death. Hearing such an unusual request, Ka\u015byapa thought, If I fulfill my wife's desire, I will fall down to hell. I ignorantly promised her not knowing her cruel intentions. I cannot give up my promise, but Indra should not be killed also. I need to find a suitable solution. Thinking thus, Ka\u015byapa spoke to Diti, I will teach you a method of worship called pumsavana vrata, that you need to perform for one year. If you follow it strictly, you will get a son who can kill Indra. Otherwise, your son will become a friend of Indra. Diti enthusiastically said, I will follow the vrata strictly. Please tell me all its rules and regulations. Ka\u015byapa Muni instructed Diti, While doing this pumsavana vrata, you should not harm or curse anyone, speak lies, touch impure things, or associate with sinful people. You should worship cows, br\u0101hma\u0146as, Goddess Lak\u1e63m\u012b and Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana. Diti eagerly started the vrata. Understanding Diti's purpose, Indra came in disguise and started serving Diti. He carefully observed her routine just to find a fault in her vrata. He daily brought flowers, fruits, roots, wood, ku\u015ba grass, leaves, sprouts and water at the proper time for her worship of Lak\u1e63m\u012b N\u0101r\u0101y\u0101\u0146a. Just as a hunter covers himself with a deerskin and becomes like a deer to kill a deer. Unable to find any faults in her practice, he became worried. One day, Diti unfortunately neglected to wash her mouth, hands and feet after eating, and went to sleep during the evening time. Finding this fault, Indra entered her womb with his mystic powers, while she was fast asleep. With his thunderbolt, he cut her embryo into seven pieces. But they became seven children. He then cut each of them in to seven pieces again. These forty-nine pieces became forty-nine children, and Indra was surprised. Being aggrieved, the children pleaded to Indra with folded hands, Dear Indra, we are your brothers, the Maruts. Why are you trying to kill us? When Indra heard their appeal, he said, You were supposed to be the cause of my death, but since you are all my brothers, you have nothing to fear. I shall not kill you. Meanwhile Diti got up from her sleep and saw her forty-nine sons, as brilliant as fire, and in friendship with Indra. Diti saw Indra and asked him, I performed this vrata just to get a son to kill you. I prayed for only one son, but now there are forty-nine. How has this happened? Please tell me the truth. Indra replied, My dear mother! Being selfish, I came to find fault in your vrata and cut your embryo. When I cut the child into seven pieces, seven children appeared. When I cut each of them into seven pieces, forty-nine children appeared. None of them died. Seeing this great wonder, I understood that this is a result of your sincere worship of Lak\u1e63m\u012b N\u0101r\u0101yana. I am a fool. Kindly excuse me for my sinful acts. Diti was pleased by Indra's truthfulness and humility, Diti gave up her anger. Because she worshipped Lord Visnu wholeheartedly for a long time, her sons became equal to the devat\u0101s. Then, Indra offered respects to her, and with her permission went to heaven with his brothers, the forty-nine Maruts. Ka\u015byapa was delighted with the transformation in Diti. Wise people expertly engage common people in the worship of Lord Visnu to purify their bad intentions.",
        "activity": "1. Recall any other personality form the Bhagavatam who worshiped the Lord with material desires, but was purified later. 2. Do you believe that Diti's desire to have a son to kill Indra is justified? Explain.",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON TRANSFORMATION: Ideally one should worship God selflessly. But what if someone performs bhakti with evil desires? Will the Lord show mercy on such people? - The answer to this question is so beautifully depicted in this story. Diti had a malicious desire to kill Indra, but Ka\u015byapa tactfully engaged her in worshiping the Lord, by which she was purified of her evil intentions. Sincere practice of bhakti transforms the hearts of even selfish people. Therefore, whatever may be our mood or desire, we can perform bhakti of Lord Vi\u015fnu or Kr\u015f\u0146a, and that bhakti shall purify us of all unwanted qualities. If someone with selfish motives is purified by bhakti, what to speak of performing bhakti with pure intentions to serve the Lord.",

        "title": "The Philosophical Demon",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 7",
        "story": "Hirany\u0101k\u015fa and Hiranyaka\u015bipu were two powerful asuras born of Diti and Ka\u015byapa. Hirany\u0101k\u1e63a performed severe austerities and received great boons from Lord Bramh\u0101. As a result, he became very proud and tormented the entire universe. To end his atrocities and rescue the world, Lord Vi\u015fnu appeared as a divine boar, Varahadeva, and heroically killed him. Hearing the news of his brother's death, Hiranyaka\u015bipu became enraged and began biting his lips. He gazed at the sky with fierce glances and frowning eyebrows. He summoned his demoniac companions ragingly and said, O \u015aambara, Namuci, Vipracitti and other R\u0101k\u1e63asas, please hear me. Although Lord Vi\u015fnu is equal to everyone, just like a restless child, He sided with the insignificant devat\u0101s who were His devotees. In the form of a boar, He mercilessly slayed my well-wishing brother Hiranyak\u015fa! I will soon behead that diplomatic Vi\u015fnu with my trident! With His blood, I shall please my brother, who is very fond of drinking blood. When a tree's root is cut, the branches and twigs automatically shrivel up. Similarly, when Vi\u015fnu is killed, the devat\u0101s will automatically become powerless. Therefore, Hiranyaka\u015bipu continued, while I execute my plan of killing Vi\u015fnu, you asuras should destroy everyone engaged in sacrifices, Vedic study, and dharma. The earth is flourishing because of the pious br\u0101hma\u0146as and their austerities. If we stop all their spiritual activities, we can easily destroy the devat\u0101s and Vi\u015fnu. By nature, the demons love creating chaos. Having received the orders of Hiranyakasipu, they became even more enthusiastic. They set cities, villages, gardens, fields, forests, hermitages, and cowsheds ablaze. They didn't even spare the trees. Being disturbed by their malicious activities, innocent people were forced to give up the Vedic culture. As a result of the yaj\u00f1as stopping, the devat\u0101s didn't receive their share of oblations and were thus dissatisfied. Havoc and misery rampaged in all directions. Meanwhile, Hiranyaka\u015bipu performed the last rites of Hiranyak\u015fa. Seeing his mother, Diti, sister-in-law, nephews, and family members heartbroken, Hiranyaka\u015bipu began consoling them. Being an expert diplomat, he was well-versed in the art of speaking according to the situation. He said, Dear relatives, please don't mourn the death of my brother. He was a great hero who died gloriously while battling his enemy. We cannot control birth and death. We come together as members of the same family only until our karma keeps us together. Once that karma is exhausted, we head to different destinations. Like travelers who meet at a restaurant for some time and then depart after enjoying the meals, we, too, come together for a while and then part ways. Also, unlike the body, the soul is eternal. Therefore, we shouldn't feel depressed at the loss of a person because death is unavoidable. Hiranyaka\u015bipu then narrated the tale of a great king as follows: Once there lived a king named Suyaj\u00f1a who ruled the province of U\u015f\u012bnara. One day, in a deadly battle, he was killed by his sly enemies. His solid armor lay smashed, ornaments scattered, hair disarrayed, and eyes lifeless. His body was smeared entirely with blood while his heart was pierced with razor-sharp arrows. He thus fell on the battlefield. Upon hearing this, all his queens came running to his dead body. Being dismayed, they wept profusely. Thinking about their dear husband, their hair scattered about their faces while their ornaments fell to the ground. Their condition evoked sympathy from others. Recollecting their loving exchanges with the king, they continued wailing. Even at sunset, they obstructed their husband's body from being burnt. Their loud cries reached the ears of Yamar\u0101ja, the lord of death. Yamar\u0101ja then personally came from Yamaloka. He appeared before the queens as a little boy and said, Alas, it is amazing that these people older than me, who have seen hundreds of births and deaths, are still bewildered. No one can avoid death! Why can't they understand this? The Lord who has protected us in our mother's womb will surely protect us everywhere. By His will, people will live, and when He sanctions, people will die. Hence, one shouldn't become confused and dysfunctional with the death of relatives. Then, the boy (Yamar\u0101ja) narrated a small story: Once, there lived a hunter in a forest who sustained himself by killing birds. One day, he saw a pair of birds and cunningly captured the female bird in his net. She then began crying profusely. Seeing his wife in danger, the male bird lamented and said, Alas, destiny is so merciless. My wife has been put in this awkward situation. Let me also have the same fate. My wife is half of my body. What is the use of my living without her? Our children are completely helpless. How can I maintain them without my wife? In this way, the male bird lamented. Meanwhile, the hunter killed the male bird, too, with an arrow. After narrating the story of the birds, Yamar\u0101ja spoke to the queens of Suyaj\u00f1a, O foolish women, even if you lament for hundreds of years, your husband will not become alive. And in the meantime, your lives will also be finished. Hearing these words of wisdom, everyone was struck with wonder. Then Yamar\u0101ja disappeared. And the funeral ceremony of Suyaj\u00f1a was conducted. Thus, speaking many philosophical stories, Hiranyaka\u015bipu consoled his relatives, who then felt a sense of peace. What do you think Hiranyaka\u015bipu did after this? Did he philosophically console himself too? Or, did he act on his evil plan by attacking Lord Visnu, avenging his brother's death? That only the next chapter can tell! So, why wait?",
        "quotes": "Wicked people are those who like to trouble innocent people unnecessarily., The soul, which is different from the body, never dies. At some point or the other, the body is sure to perish. Those who know this do not lament unnecessarily.",
        "activity": "1. 'Actions speak louder than words' is a popular idiom. How do you think this applies to this story? 2. Did you promise something but failed to keep it? Think why! 3.

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON INTEGRITY: Integrity is the quality of honestly sticking to moral values in all circumstances. Such a person's thoughts, words, and actions are perfectly aligned. But asuras like Hiranyaka\u015bipu lack such integrity, mainly because they are attached to the so-called happiness they attain from immoral actions. Sometimes they speak great wisdom, but their behavior indicates the opposite. Even if they might know what's right and wrong, they choose to tread the wrong way. So learning from their mistakes, let's not simply memorize some philosophy but also try to apply it with integrity!",

        "title": "Austerities For Immortality",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 7",
        "story": "Although Hiranyaka\u015bipu pacified his relatives by speaking lofty philosophy, he preferred not to practice it. He maintained revengeful feelings toward Lord Visnu and wanted to kill Him. He desired to become immortal and unconquerable, and rule the entire universe. Intending to gain special powers from lord Bramh\u0101, Hiranyaka\u015bipu set off for the great Mandara Mountain. He performed severe austerities (tapasya), standing on his toes, pointing his huge arms upwards, and glancing at the sky. Even the devat\u0101s were surprised seeing his intense tapasya. Fire emanated from his head and spread everywhere while burning all the planets. The rivers and oceans were agitated while the mountains and islands started crumbling. The stars and planets were set ablaze as they fell in different directions.The scared devat\u0101s approached lord Brahm\u0101 and pleaded, O lord! We cannot stay on our planets because of the rising heat levels. Please stop these disturbances caused by Hiranyaka\u015bipu's austerities. He wants to occupy your auspicious post. If it happens, everything will be lost. Kindly help us in this situation. Upon hearing the complaints of the devatas, Lord Brahma decided to go to Hiranyakasipu. Accompanied by great sages like Bhrgu, he then reached Mandara Mountain. On arriving there, Brahma was initially unable to see Hiranyakasipu, for his body was covered by an anthill, tall grasses, and thorny bamboos. The ants had eaten up the skin of Hiranyakas\u0131pu without sparing his flesh and blood! Half of his body was totally eaten up! Still, Hiranyakasipu continued his severe austerities with great determination. Finally, Brahm\u0101 spotted Hiranyakasipu, went close to him, and said, Dear Hiranyakasipu, your austerities are astonishing. Despite being eaten by all kinds of insects, your life is still circulating within your bones! Even great sages haven't performed such austerities in the past, and neither will anyone be able to do so in the future. You sustained your life even without water for 100 celestial years! I'm impressed with your austerity. You can ask for whatever boon you desire. Then, lord Brahm\u0101 revived Hiranyaka\u015bipu by sprinkling over him divine water from his kamandalu (water pot). Thus enlivened, Hiranyakasipu arose like a young man, with his body as strong as a mountain. He was delighted to see Brahm\u0101, and fell flat on the ground in respect. He rose, and with tears in his eyes, he prayed, O lord, please fulfill my wish. Let me not meet death by way of any of the living beings created by you; within or outside any home; during the daytime or at night; on the ground or in the sky; by any weapon, human being or animal, by any living or non-living entity, by any devat\u0101 or asura or snakes. Let me not have any rivals. Please give me sole lordship over all the living beings and devat\u0101s. Please bless me with all the mystic powers. Lord Brahm\u0101 was obliged to give all the boons Hiranyaka\u015bipu asked for. He said, Dear Hiranyaka\u015bipu, although these boons are very difficult to obtain, I shall grant them to you. Brahma then departed. Having received such boons, Hiranyaka\u015bipu became formidably powerful. He was nearly immortal. What do you think he did next? Equipped with the rarest of all boons, was he able to conquer Lord Vi\u015fnu? Flip forward to finding out!",
        "quotes": "Determination is a great virtue, but if it is coupled with evil intensions, it only leads to destruction., The devatas are not always happy to grant boons to asuras, but sometimes they are obliged.",
        "activity": "1. Name a few asuras who performed austerities for evil purposes. 2. Name a few devotees who performed austerities for noble purposes. 3.

Austerity performed for selfish and evil purposes disturbs the world. But when austerity is performed to worship the Lord, it creates peace and prosperity for one and all. Hiranyakasipu performed austerities to become immortal. But death is unavoidable. Despite one's intelligent plans to be immortal, one cannot escape the laws of nature that work under God's control. Instead of performing austerities to escape death in this temporary world, if one performs devotional service to the Lord, one can attain the 'death-free' spiritual kingdom.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 7",
        "story": "After being awarded the rarest boons from lord Brahm\u0101, Hiranyakasipu's body turned a shining gold. He was brimming with immeasurable strength. Thus, he became extremely proud. Recalling the death of his dear brother Hirany\u0101ksa, he continued being envious of Lord Visnu. Traveling throughout the universe, he conquered the three worlds of the devat\u0101s, humans, and serpents. The leaders of various planets of the universe bowed down to him. Hiranyaka\u015bipu occupied Indra's heavenly palace built by the celestial architect Vi\u015bvakarma, and began using it as his residence. Filled with all kinds of enjoyment, the palace was also ornamented with celestial gardens that boast colorful canopies and ruby-studded seats. The steps leading to the door of the celestial mansion were made of coral, while its floors were bedecked with emeralds. The walls were made of clear crystal, and the tall columns were made of rare gems. The rooms consisted of beddings covered with foam-like silken cloth with precious pearls stitched onto it. While residing in such a luxuriant palace, Hiranyaka\u015bipu oppressed the devat\u0101s. He causelessly troubled them. Always intoxicated, with rolling eyes, he enjoyed all facilities. Except for Brahm\u0101, Vi\u015fnu, and \u015aiva, he oppressed all the principle leaders of all the planets. Additionally, he controlled mother nature. Mother earth would provide abundant food grains without being plowed, while the cows supplied milk profusely. The seven great oceans (of saltwater, ghee, sugar cane juice, milk, yogurt, sweet water, and wine) and the rivers supplied him with various gems and jewels. The outer space was adorned with wonderful phenomena for his happiness. Lush mountains and valleys served as fields of pleasure for Hiranyakasipu. Trees and plants produced fruits and flowers perennially. He singlehandedly carried out all the functions of all the devat\u0101s. Thus, he passed a long time while being proud of His opulence and disobeying all scriptural principles. Yet, Hiranyaka\u015bipu's uncontrolled senses made him dissatisfied. Troubled by the unjust punishments of Hiranyaka\u015bipu, the devat\u0101s took shelter in Lord Visnu. They prayed, O Lord, please protect us from this tyrant. Then, Lord Vi\u015fnu spoke to the devat\u0101s in a grave voice while remaining invisible to their eyes. The Lord's voice resounded in all directions while reassuring the devat\u0101s of their safety. Lord Vi\u015fnu spoke thus, Do not fear devat\u0101s! I wish all good fortune to you. I know the evil acts of Hiranyaka\u015bipu and will stop them soon. Please wait patiently until I appear. When one is envious of the devat\u0101s, the Vedas, cows, br\u0101hma\u0146as, Vaisnavas, and dharma, one will soon be vanquished by Me. When Hiranyaka\u015bipu harasses his godly son Prahl\u0101da, I shall kill him despite the boons he has received from Brahm\u0101. Thus assured by the Lord, the devat\u0101s offered Him obeisances and considered Hiranyaka\u015bipu dead already. Hiranyaka\u015bipu had four wonderful sons, out of which the best was Prahlada. He was an embodiment of all good qualities. He was kind to the poor, unlike a father. He was affectionate to his friends like a brother and respectful to his gurus like a servant. He was endowed with good education, wealth, and beauty, and was free form pride and envy. He was undisturbed by all dangers. Although born in the family of asuras, Prahlada inherited none of the demoniac qualities. Prahlada was naturally an unalloyed devotee of Lord Krsna. He was aninterested in childish play, and his mind was fully captivated by the Shoughts of the Lord. He saw his beloved Lord Govinda everywhere Feeling the loving embrace of his Lord while sitting, walking, eating, drinking, and talking, he experienced boundless spiritual bliss. How the son of a cruel Hiranyaka\u015bipu became such a gentle devotee like Prahlada? Well then, find out how in the next chapter.",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON MISUSING POWER: Just like a bully may misuse one's power to oppress the weak, Hiranyakasipu, having gained great boons from Brahm\u00e4 used his power to torture, innocent people. With power comes great responsibility. Power used to fulfill evil intentions is harmful to oneself and others. Although demons like Hiranyakasipu may receive the greatest of powers and best of facilities, they remain unsatisfied at heart. If we misuse the power we have, power will not come to our rescue when we need it the most. Such was the case with Hiranyakasipu.",

        "story": "When Hiranyaka\u015bipu was performing austerities to receive boons from lord Brahma, the devat\u0101s attacked his kingdom. The devat\u0101s, headed by Indra, thought to themselves, Hiranyaka\u015bipu will now be defeated, just as small ants eat a snake. Intending to destroy the leaders of the asuras, the devat\u0101s invaded Hiranyakasipu's kingdom unannounced. Seeing them, the asuras fled in different directions. The devat\u0101s then entered Hiranyaka\u015bipu's palace and saw his chaste wife, Kay\u0101dhu, who was then pregnant. Indra approached Kay\u0101dhu and arrested her. She then began crying helplessly, just like a small bird captured by a big vulture. But Indra and the other devat\u0101s continued to drag her mercilessly. At that time, the great sage N\u00e4rada Muni appeared there. Stopping the devat\u0101s from doing so, he said, What are you doing? This woman is a sinless and chaste wife of another man. How can you drag her off mercilessly in this way? You must release her immediately! N\u0101rada Muni was a great saint and a pure devotee of Lord Visnu. The devat\u0101s were very respectful and obedient to him. Revealing his plan to N\u0101rada, Indra spoke, O sage, we don't want to kill this woman. She is currently carrying the child of Hiranyaka\u015bipu in her womb. Just as Hiranyaka\u015bipu is a cruel demon, his son will also become a great demon and unnecessarily torment innocent people, like his father. So, we wish to kill him as soon as he is born. After that, we will release this woman. N\u0101rada Muni understood the fear and concern of the devat\u0101s. He then clarified to them, Dear devat\u0101s, you expect Hiranyaka\u015bipu's child to be another tyrant like him. But the child in the womb of this sinless woman will become a powerful devotee of Lord Visnu. He will grow into a mah\u0101 bh\u0101gavata (a great devotee). Therefore, killing him would be a great offense. Hearing this, the devat\u0101s headed by Indra immediately released Kay\u0101dhu. They deeply trusted the words of Narada Muni. They even circumambulated Kay\u0101dhu and bowed down to her and the devotee within her womb. The devat\u0101s were obedient to N\u0101rada Muni because whatever a pure devotee says would be very authoritative. Kay\u0101dhu was very much worried and frightened. Seeing her pitiable condition, Narada Muni compassionately brought her to his own \u0101\u015brama. He told her, You can stay here until your husband returns. You will be safe here. There is no need for you to fear. Kay\u0101dhu continued to stay under the care of Narada Muni. She desired to give birth to Prahlada after the arrival of her husband. Meanwhile, she respectfully rendered various services at N\u00e4rada Muni's \u0101\u015brama. One day, Narada Muni sat in front of Kay\u0101dhu and started enlightening her with a spiritual discourse. He was merciful towards the mother and the child in her womb. He wanted to enlighten both of them by speaking about Lord Vi\u015fnu and the process of bhakti yoga. N\u00e4rada Muni explained that the nature of a living being is to serve the Supreme Lord Vi\u015fnu eternally lovingly. Kay\u0101dhu heard N\u0101rada's instructions but not very attentively. She was very much concerned about the safety of the child in her womb. Also, she earnestly waited for her husband's return. As a result, she could not grasp the divine instructions and teachings of Narada Muni. Thus, she forgot whatever she heard.But, the child within Kay\u0101dhu's womb was very attentive to the teachings of Narada Muni. Free of any worry and anxiety, he focussed on the great sage's wisdom words. He understood that the goal of life is to perform bhakti unto Vi\u015fnu. In due course of time, that child came to be known as Prahlada, the most celebrated devotee in the history of the universe. Thus, Prahl\u0101da became a pure devotee even before his birth. After Prahlada was born, he exhibited great devotion to Lord Vi\u015fnu while constantly chanting 'Hari Hari.' How do you think Hiranyaka\u015bipu treated Prahlada? Would the Lord's enemy, Hiranyakasipu, be comfortable seeing his son becoming a devotee of Krsna? What action would Hiranyaka\u015bipu take? Flip forward to finding out!",

Thus, inspiration in bhakti doesn't depend on external conditions like age, caste, dynasty, etc. Bhakti is completely independent.

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 7",
        "story": "Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya was the guru of the asuras. He was a learned brahmana. A real br\u0101hmana guides people in spiritual life, but Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya accepted the priesthood of asuras just for material benefits. He had two sons, namely Sanda and Amarka. They lived near Hiranyaka\u015bipu's palace. When Prahal\u0101da turned five, he was sent to the school of Sanda and Amarka along with the other asura children. Prahlada was already knowledgeable because he had received spiritual education from the best teacher, Narada Muni. Despite this, he was sent to school for material education. Sanda and Amarka started teaching him politics, diplomacy, and differentiating between people as enemies and friends. But Prahlada didn't like those teachings. One day Hiranyaka\u015bipu called little Prahl\u0101da and made him sit on his lap. He then affectionately asked, My dear son, how are you studying at school? Please tell me about your favorite subject? Prahl\u0101da replied, Dear father, I think the best activity for all living beings is to give up their selfish nature and the thoughts of 'I and mine. Therefore, everyone should give up their materialistic household life, go to the forest of Vrindavan, and take complete shelter of Lord Hari. Hiranyaka\u015bipu expected Prahlada to speak something sweet but not anything practical. Certainly, he didn't expect such a profound philosophical reply from his young son. He was surprised to hear Prahlada's words and started laughing. He then spoke gravely, It looks like some enemies are secretly entering the school and polluting children's minds. I must protect Prahlada from the devotees going to the Gurukul in the disguise of brahma\u0146as. Sanda and Amarka, were surprised to see that a child could speak such great words of devotion. However, they were also very afraid. They thought that Prahlada's devotion unto Lord Hari would cause Hiranyaka\u015bipu to kill them. Thus Sanda and Amarka lovingly spoke to Prahlada, Dear child, all good fortune unto you. Please tell us the truth. Who has polluted your intelligence? Other boys don't speak like you! Where did you learn all this bhakti philosophy from? We never taught this to you. Hari and His devotees are our enemies. So how can you praise Him? Prahlada politely replied, My dear teachers, no one is our enemy. Everyone is a child of God. I offer my respects to Lord Hari, by whose grace one's bad intelligence is destroyed. My intelligence is different from yours because of Lord Hari, your so-called enemy. My consciousness is naturally attracted to Lord Vi\u015fnu just as iron is naturally attracted to a magnet. Hearing this, Sanda and Amarka scolded Prahl\u0101da, Bring a stick! This boy deserves punishment. By his bad intelligence, he is defaming our dynasty. He's like a thorn tree in the sandalwood forest of the R\u0101k\u1e63asa dynasty. If Visnu is like the axe to cut the Rakshasa forest, then Prahlada is the handle of that axe. Later, Sanda and Amarka forcefully taught Prahl\u0101da many materialistic subjects like politics and diplomacy. But Prahl\u0101da had no bitter feelings towards Sanda and Amarka or even Hiranyakashipu, who troubled him in many ways. After a few days, they presented Prahlada before Hiranyaka\u015bipu, thinking that the boy was sufficiently educated. That day Prahlada was nicely dressed and decorated by his mother, Kay\u0101dhu. Prahl\u0101da respectfully bowed down to his father, Hiranyakasipu. He was pleased with his son's behavior, so Hiranyaka\u015bipu happily embraced him and showered his blessings. Then, with tears of affection in his eyes, he placed Prahlada on his lap and asked, My dear son, please repeat whatever you liked the most from what your teachers taught you. This time Hiranyaka\u015bipu asked a specific question. Instead of asking Prahlada to speak whatever he liked, he asked him to speak what his teachers taught. But Prahl\u0101da had two types of teachers, a spiritual teacher (Narada) and materialistic teachers (Sanda and Amarka). Remembering the teachings of Narada Muni, Prahl\u0101da wittily replied, My dear father, there are nine ways of performing bhakti unto Lord Visnu. One who follows one or more or all of these nine limbs of bhakti unto Lord Visnu or Krsna is the most knowledgeable person. Hiranyakasipu became furious and chastised the teachers, You unqualified brahmanas! You have disobeyed my orders and taught this poor boy nonsensical philosophy about Visnu, our sworn enemy. You are my enemies in the disguise of friends. \u015aanda and Amarka replied, O King! We did not teach anything that your son spoke. Please don't accuse us unnecessarily. Prahl\u0101da's devotion to Vi\u015fnu is natural in Him. Hiranyaka\u015bipu then asked Prahlada, You are the most degraded one in our family! If your gurus haven't taught this, how did you develop this devotional mentality? Prahl\u0101da replied, Dear father, bhakti unto Krsna is not developed by those people who are not self-controlled. Because of their uncontrolled senses, they enter hellish life and repeatedly chew the chewed, i.e., desire same temporary pleasures. They don't understand that Lord Vi\u015fnu is their real shelter and goal. They become ambitious to enjoy in this world. They become blind to spiritual life, following other blind people. Thus, they are strongly bound by the ropes of material miseries. On the other hand, those who take shelter of pure devotees and serve Lord Visnu with love are freed from the cycle of repeated birth and death and ultimately enter Vaikuntha, the Lord's eternal abode. As Prahlada was speaking such words, Hiranyaka\u015bipu was bursting with fury, Blinded by anger and pride, he threw the child off his lap onto the ground. His eyes became reddish like burning copper. How did he act next? Did he punish Prahlada or forgive him, considering him a child? That only the next chapter can reveal. So why wait?",

Generally, a child fears being scolded and chastised by a strict elder, but little Prahlada fearlessly opposed the mentality of his aesthetic father and teachers. He was polite and humble, yet he never compromised his devotion to Lord Visnu. Such fearlessness and humility are the natural symptoms of devotion to God. When one becomes fully dependent on the Lord, one is devoid of all material fears. However, when we turn our face away from God, we are naturally situated amidst fears and anxieties. Fixing our hearts on the lord will 'frighten' the fear in us!",

        "story": "Prahlada thus openly expressed his devotion to Visnu in front of Hiranyakasipu. He even advised his father to become a devotee. Hiranyaka\u015bipu became enraged at this. Although he could overrule everyone in his vast kingdom, including the powerful devat\u0101s, he was agitated when a five-year-old boy didn't obey him. He gave up his love for his little son, unable to tolerate the boy's love for Lord Visnu. Being unable to tolerate his son glorifying his enemy, Hiranyaka\u015bipu ordered his servants, O demons, this boy deserves to be killed. He is untrustworthy and has become devoted to our enemy while forsaking his parent's affection. This foolish boy is like an unwanted black spot on our spotless dynasty. Prahl\u0101da remained silent while all the palace residents were surprised to hear their king's order to kill his son! Hard-hearted Hiranyaka\u015bipu continued, A rare medicinal herb in the forest must be protected if it helps cure a disease. But if a bodily limb is diseased, it must be amputated so that the rest of the body remains unaffected. Similarly, even if an outsider is favorable, he must be protected just like a son. And even one's son must be rejected if he acts against the family. Therefore, killing this boy is perfectly justified. Kill him immediately! All the demoniac soldiers rushed forward to kill Prahlada, who peacefully meditated on Lord Visnu. However, by Lord Hari's mercy, none of the deadly tridents and clubs hurled at Prahlada could touch him. Astonished, Hiranyaka\u015bipu irritably ordered his servants to kill Prahl\u0101da using other means. Then the asura soldiers took Prahlada away and threw him under the feet of mad elephants to get trampled upon. But Prahl\u0101da didn't die. Then they locked him in a dark room filled with huge venomous snakes. Still, he didn't die. Next, they pushed him down the peak of a big mountain. They imprisoned and starved him in a black cell. They poisoned him They exposed Prahlada to severe cold, winds, fire, and water. Finally, they released boulders to crush his tender body. Still, by all these means, they could not kill Prahlada. When all the attempts to kill Prahlada failed, Hiranyakasipu became greatly perplexed. He thought, I tried to the boy in all possible ways, yet, he remains unhurt. Despite being a small child, he's completely fearless. He never forgets his beloved Lord. He's just like a stubborn dog's tail that never straightens. His strength appears to be unlimited, and he seems to be immortal. What if I die because of my enmity towards him? Wondering in this way, Hiranyaka\u015bipu disappointedly sat down on his throne. At that time, \u015aanda and Amarka approached Hiranyaka\u015bipu and secretly murmured, O King, why are you so sad? There is no reason for you to be so disappointed. You have conquered all three worlds. All the devat\u0101s are afraid simply of the movement of your eyebrows. It's better not to take Prahl\u0101da seriously. He is a mere child and will surely give up his devotion when he grows up. We will train him. Hiranyaka\u015bipu accepted the suggestions of \u015aanda and Amarka and sent Prahl\u0101da again with them to the Gurukul. What did Prahlada do in school? Did his teachers become successful in destroying his devotion? Read the next chapter to find out.",

The Lord personally takes the responsibility of protecting His faithful devotees from all dangers. Faith in God's protection is very rare. It's easier to think of one's happiness and success as God-sent, but when one faces difficulties and failures, one doubts the Lord's mercy.

        "story": "Prahlada, as usual, was very submissive and humble to his elders. Sanda and Amarka eagerly taught him all kinds of materialistic topics. But Prahl\u0101da remained attached to the divine teachings of bhakti given by N\u00e4rada Muni. During the absence of his teachers, Prahlada's young classmates would call him to play with them. All the children were attracted to Prahlada's gentle and loving nature. Prahl\u0101da would speak to his friends very politely and sweetly. He would also teach them bhakti. The innocent children, not yet contaminated by the materialistic teachings, eagerly listened to the words of Prahlada. They all surrounded him and heard him with fixed attention. Prahl\u0101da kindly began to teach them about bhakti: My dear friends, intelligent people should worship Lord Hari right from one's childhood. Human life is very rare. Although it is also temporary, it is very effective to perform bhakti. It is very natural for everyone to love Visnu because He is our dearest well-wisher. One should not waste human life to attain some material pleasures and facilities. Rather one should utilize one's life to worship the Lord Visnu. Prahlada continued, Human life is about a hundred years. Out of those hundred years, most of the time is spent sleeping, sporting activities, old age, etc. The rest of the time is spent making unnecessary attachments and fulfilling material desires. Instead of being so absorbed in just external duties in this material world, one should better try to please Lord N\u0101r\u0101yana, who is the Father of all beings. He is very merciful to everyone. By surrendering unto Him, one can attain Him in His eternal abode. I received this knowledge of bhakti from Narada Muni while in my mother's womb. At the time, my mother was under the care of Narada Muni. The children of the asuras were surprised to see the devotion of their dear friend Prahlada. Prahlada continued, Bhakti is the best spiritual path by which one becomes liberated from this material world. One should perform bhakti under the guidance of a bona fide guru. And one must faithfully worship the Lord in the company of other devotees. According to the scriptures, one should hear about the Lord and meditate upon Him. One must also be very respectful and loving towards all living beings. Thus, one will be freed from all bad qualities and attain the love of the Lord. So, I request all of you to take to perform bhakti. In this way, Prahlada lovingly educated his friends. All the children found Prahlada's teachings more interesting than the discourses of their teachers. Because Prahl\u0101da was a great devotee, he could easily gift devotion to his friends. Inspired by Prahlada, the children began to chant the holy names of Lord Hari. Then, they joyfully started singing and dancing along with Prahlada while chanting. While they were thus absorbed in bhakti, \u015aanda and Amarka suddenly saw them and were shocked. What action did the teachers take then? Did they chastise Prahlada or the other students? Or did they also get transformed into devotees? Flip forward to find out.",

Later, Prahlada passed on those teachings to his classmates thus inspiring them. The effectiveness of one's teachings depends on how sincerely one has heard and followed the guru's teachings, and how transparently one transmits them to others. Because Prahlada sincerely followed N\u00e4rada Muni's teachings, he could pass on that knowledge to his friends. Thus, authentic devotional knowledge is always passed down by a succession of genuine teachers and students called as the parampar\u0101.",

        "story": "Seeing all the Gurukul boys becoming Lord Hari's devotees, Sanda and Amarka became worried. So they immediately went to Hiranyaka\u015bipu and informed him about these events. Hearing the brahmanas, Hiranyaka\u015bipu became enraged. Hissing like a trampled snake, he called for Prahlada. Undisturbed by his father's anger, Prahlada stood with a peaceful mind and folded hands. Hiranyaka\u015bipu spoke like thunder, O impudent boy! Your unintelligent acts have defamed our family. You are the lowest among men. How dare you violate my orders! Today, I shall send you to hell. When I become angry, the planets begin trembling, then by whose power are you so fearless? Prahl\u0101da gently replied, Dear father, please understand that the source of my strength is the source of your strength as well. Lord Hari is the source of everybody's strength in this world. The Supreme Lord is the creator, maintainer, and destroyer of all the universes. Prahlada continued, My dear father, please give up your demonic mentality of discriminating between friends and enemies. The only enemy of a person in this world is one's uncontrolled mind. All other kinds of enemies are mere imaginations. Therefore, one will have no enemies if one conquers the mind and senses, gives up one's bad qualities like anger, envy, and greed, and treats everyone equally. Hearing this profound reply from Prahlada, Hiranyaka\u015bipu shouted, Your foolish words are only increasing my desire to kill you with my own hands. You rascal are boasting as if you are more self-controlled than me! Where is your beloved God? You always describe Him as the all-pervading! If He's everywhere, is He present in this pillar too? Hiranyaka\u015bipu pointed to a huge pillar in the royal palace and challenged Prahlada, I shall now slash your head off. Let me see if your Lord comes from this pillar to protect you. Hiranyakasipu then took out his sharp sword. Obsessed with anger, he struck his fist against the pillar. Thud! From the pillar came a fearful sound that appeared to destroy the entire universe. Hiranyaka\u015bipu stood astonished. He had never heard such a massive sound earlier. Fright took over the faces of the other demons in the palace.To save His dear devotee, the omniscient Lord Visnu appeared in the most wonderful form that had never been witnessed. That form was a fusion of a robust man and a ferocious lion. Puzzled, Hiranyaka\u015bipu wondered, What is this weird being breaking out from this pillar? This was the manifestation of the fearsome Supreme Lord, Narasimha (the half man half lion incarnation). Curious, Hiranyaka\u015bipu began detailing the form of the Lord within his mind. The Lord had angry eyes resembling molten gold. His mane shone while his deadly teeth covered the movements of his sword-like tongue. His gaping mouth was an invitation for all demons to be burnt. His nostrils appeared like dark mountain caves. His broad chest seemed thrust into the sky, while his bodily hairs resembled the moon's splendor. Hiranyaka\u015bipu had never seen such a being, so he never asked a boon from Brahm\u0101 to be protected from such ghastly creatures. But lo and behold! This was the omnipotence of Lord Visnu. Mustering some courage, Hiranyaka\u015bipu attacked the Lord with his small club, thinking he would be safe owing to the boons that Brahm\u0101 he received. However, the Lord effortlessly tossed away the club and captured him. The Lord's radiating bright effulgence made Hiranyaka\u015bipu invisible. To enjoy the spirit of fighting, the Lord left Hiranyakasipu gave him another chance to fight. However, and gav Hiranyaka\u015bipu foolishly thought that the Lord was afraid of his powers and backed off. And the devat\u0101s witnessing the fight from the upper planets became anxious to see the Lord leaving Hiranyaka\u015bipu. Again, Hiranyakasipu attacked the Lord with a sharp sword and shield. Laughing loudly, the Lord captured him with speed faster than that of a gliding hawk. Then the Lord dragged the demon to the doorway and effortlessly tore him apart. Lord Narshima could have easily killed Hiranyaka\u015bipu with a simple snap of His fingers. But He wanted to respect the boons that Brahm\u0101 gave the demon. That's why Lord Narasimha killed Hiranyaka\u015bipu by piercing him at the door, which was neither inside nor outside his house. He placed Hiranyaka\u015bipu on His lap, which was neither a part of the sky nor land. He pierced him with His nails, which were neither living nor dead weapons. He killed him during twilight, which was neither a part of day nor night. Thus, the Lord wittingly annihilated Hiranya\u015bipu only to save His devotee, Prahl\u0101da. Lord Narasimha's mouth and mane were drenched in shiny red blood. It was impossible for anyone to even glance at His ferocious eyes. Decorated with a garland of the demon's intestines, the Lord resembled a ferocious lion that had just slayed an elephant. Then the Lord uprooted Hiranyaka\u015bipu's heart and examined it thoroughly. He thought, This place is where I should reside. Why did this person let demoniac qualities like anger, greed, and envy take My place? Thus, the Lord killed Hiranyakasipu and his demoniac associates. Seeing no one to fight Him, the Lord went towards his throne and majestically seated Himself on it. Having thus stationed Himself on the throne, what would the Lord do? Would He stay there a little longer? Would He occupy the kingdom of Hiranyaka\u015bipu? Read the last chapter of this section to know.",
        "quotes": "A devotee is firmly convinced that the Lord is the source of eveything, and everyone ultimately depends on Him., Atheists keep challenging the existence of God, but a devotee continues to worship God., Material boons of so-called immortality are very difficult to attain and maintain.

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON FAITH: Our unmoving and firm belief in something is called conviction. Devotees who deeply love God are convinced about His presence everywhere.

Of course, the Lord is not obliged to reveal Himself to such people. But when they trouble the devotees, the Lord indeed comes to protect His devotees. One must first understand from the scriptures that the Lord is everywhere, and then we must worship Him with devotion. Then, gradually, by the Lord's mercy, one will see His presence everywhere.",

        "title": "The Love of Lord Narasimha",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 7",
        "story": "In his previous life, Hiranyaka\u015bipu was a great devotee. He was Jaya, the gatekeeper in Vaikuntha. Owing to the curse of the four Kum\u0101ras, he became a demon, along with Vijaya, his co-gatekeeper. Lord Narasimha sat on Hiranyaka\u015bipu's throne only to indicate that His devotees are always fortunate in all circumstances. After Hiranyakasipu's death, the wives of the devat\u0101s showered flowers on Lord Narasimha out of great joy. The sky was crowded with airplanes of the devat\u0101s, who began to beat drums and play other melodious musical instruments. The heavenly women danced, and the Gandharvas sang sweetly. Then, all the devat\u0101s and sages offered their prayers to Lord Narasimha. They expressed gratitude to the Lord for killing Hiranyaka\u015bipu and 5 restoring their powers and positions. Despite receiving great praises and prayers from many devat\u0101s and sages, Lord Narasimha was still angry. Even lord \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101 were afraid of approaching Him. Mother Lak\u1e63m\u012b also couldn't gather the courage to go near her husband. When no one could calm the Lord, Brahm\u0101 finally asked little Prahl\u0101da, My dear boy, please go and satisfy the Lord with your prayers. Only you can bring a smile across His fierce face. Prahlada agreed and joyfully proceeded towards the Lord. The Lord didn't get pacified by anyone only because He wanted His young devotee to console Him. He wanted to exhibit His affection for Prahl\u0101da. As soon as Prahl\u0101da bowed down, Lord Narasimha was overwhelmed with affection for His young devotee. The Lord lovingly placed His lotus hand on the head of Prahlada, who then developed ecstatic symptoms. With tears in his eyes, Prahl\u0101da said, O Lord, great devat\u0101s and sages couldn't satisfy You with their excellent praises. Then how is it possible for me, a member of a demoniac dynasty, to appease You? Although Prahlada was chosen to pacify the Lord when all the great devat\u0101s and sages failed, he didn't feel superior to them. Prahlada continued, My dear Lord, wealth, scholarship, beauty, intelligence, fame, and so on are not necessary to please You. You e satisfied only by loving devotion. One who doesn't possess bhakti unto You cannot please You, even if he is a well-qualified br\u0101hma\u0146a. But, on the other hand, even a person born in a family of dog-eaters can easily satisfy You with bhakti. Having thus declared that only love can please the Lord, Prahlada lovingly requested, Dear Lord, please give up Your anger, for you have already killed the demon Hiranyaka\u015bipu. Everyone is rejoicing in his death. Your ferocious form as Narasimha doesn't cause fear in my heart. I am only fearful of this material world filled with distractions and miseries. And the so-called solutions to those problems are more painful than the problems. Therefore, the only way to be freed from all world's difficulties is to take Your shelter and chant Your glories. With a grateful heart, Prahl\u0101da said, Today I have become fortunate by the touch of Your lotus hand. I received this mercy from You only because of the mercy of my guru N\u0101rada Muni. I wish to serve him. Satisfied by Prahlada's lovely prayers, Lord Narasimha gave up his anger and posed a cheerful smile on His lotus-like face. He spoke, My dear Prahlada! All good fortune unto you! Very few people are fortunate to have My dar\u015bana, but by your sublime bhakti, you Shave forced Me to come to you. I'm very pleased with your faith and devotion. Please ask for any boon from Me. Prahlada said, O Lord! Due to my demoniac birth, I'm already attached to many material desires. Now, please do not allure me with boons. I am not a stingy merchant who demands some material benefits in exchange for devotion. I am Your eternal servant and You are My eternal master. I do not want any material gifts from You. If You want to give me any boon, please destroy all my material desires. Impressed with Prahlada's pure devotion, Lord Narasimha said, Dear Prahl\u0101da, I know that you don't desire any material benefits from Me. Still, I order you to enjoy as the king of asuras until the end of this manvantara. Even though you're in this world, you can always remain in My company by constantly hearing My pastimes and thinking of Me. And you shall finally attain Me. Your pure glory will be sung even in the heavens. Anyone who remembers your activities and chants your prayers will become free from all karma. Prahl\u0101da replied, My dear Lord, You are very merciful to the fallen souls. I have one request. Out of ignorance, my father Hiranyaka\u015bipu envied You and tormented me. Please excuse his sins. The Lord replied, Dear Prahlada, because of your birth, your father and your entire demoniac dynasty have been purified. Even great sinful dynasties are sanctified if great devotees like you take birth. Your farther has already been purified by My touch at his death. Lord Brahma spoke to Lord Narasimha, O Lord of the Lords! This demon received the boon of not being killed by anyone within my creation. But You appeared in This divine form, killed him, and saved Your dear devotee. Anyone who meditates upon You will be protected from all dangers. Lord Narasimha told Brahm\u0101, Giving such boons to demons is as dangerous as feeding milk to a poisonous snake. I warn you, never give such boons to any demon again. Saying this, the Lord disappeared. After that. Prahlada was enthroned as the king of asuras in a grand ceremony by learned br\u0101hma\u0146as. One who hears the wonderful story of Prahlada and Narasimha shall develop pure devotion to the Lord.",
        "quotes": "An obeisance unto the Lord causes fearlessness in the minds of those fearful of death., Although fully qualified to serve the Lord, a devotee is always very humble., Only by the guru's grace can one attain the Lord's mercy., A devotee's service to the Lord is completely selfless without any expectations.",
        "activity": "1. Can you pray for the wellbeing of someone who tried to harm you? If so, what would you pray for? 2. Think of some devotees around you whose devotion is intense. What makes you think so? 3. The world is filled with difficulties. Does it mean we have to hate it? Share your opinion. 4. Make a small skit with your friends or family members on the story of Prahlada.",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON INTENSITY: Both a candle and a 2000-watt bulb can light up a dark room. While the dim candle flame illuminates only a corner of the room, the bulb brightens up the entire room. Similarly, if one's practice of bhakti is weak and wavering like the flame of a candle, one cannot derive the full mercy of the Lord. Progress in bhakti depends on the intent and intensity of one's practice. One who performs bhakti selfishly and irregularly cannot experience the real pleasure bhakti offers. Drawing inspiration from the character of little Prahlada, let's take baby steps to intensify our absorption in the practice of bhakti!",

        "story": "Located on the higher planets was the serene mountain range called Trik\u016bta. Comprised of three main peaks made of iron, precious silver, and fine gold, they beautified the directions and the sky. An aromatic milk ocean surrounded this mountain range. The other smaller peaks in this range housed abundant pearls, minerals, lush greenery, and abundant waterfalls. The waves of the milk ocean always washed the soft soil at the foothills and thus produced rare emeralds. The caves were populated with celestial beings. The valleys of the region were filled with wild animals, fragrant gardens, sweet chirping birds, and gems embedded in the crystalline lakes and rivers. In such a beautiful Trik\u016b\u021ba region, there was also a beautiful garden called Rtumat, which belonged to the ocean God, Varuna. In it blossomed various flowers and juicy fruit-laden trees. Splendid lotus-filled lakes surrounded by a swarm of buzzing bees added to the charm. The chirping of the birds created an extremely pleasing atmosphere. Sweet-scented Kadamba trees abundantly covered these water bodies. Gajendra, the leader of the elephants, used to live in this heavenly forest. Seeing him or even smelling his bodily odor, even ferocious animals of the forest would scatter away in fear. Surrounded by numerous elephants, Gajendra made the entire Trik\u016b\u021ba region tremble. Once, while wandering in the forest with female elephants, Gajendra felt fatigued and thirsty. Walking to a nearby lake, he started drinking its sweet waters mixed with lotus pollen. He happily bathed and played in the cool waters. With his enormous trunk, Gajendra drew out water from the lake and sprinkled it over his family in a playful mood. Suddenly, a strong crocodile angrily swam toward Gajendra and caught his leg in the water. Powerful Gajendra tried his best to free himself from the crocodile's jaws, but he couldn't. Gajendra became helpless, Anxiety took over his wives, and they started crying. Even the other elephants wanted to help Gajendra but, couldn't do anything. Gajendra and the crocodile began fighting, pulling each other in and out of the water. Gajendra thought that the crocodile would leave him in some time. But the fight went on and on for one thousand years! Seeing their fight, even the devat\u0101s in heaven were surprised. After all, Gajendra was a land animal, while the crocodile was a water animal. Gajendra would have destroyed the crocodile easily if he had attacked him while on land. But within the waters, Gajendra became weak. His mental and physical strength was depleted in water, while the crocodile's enthusiasm and strength increased. Thus, Gajendra became helpless. What do you think Gajendra did next? Would he succumb and perish, or would he somehow rise and defeat the crocodile? Well, turning the page may be a good call!",

        "story": "In a helpless state, Gajendra started thinking, All my relatives and friends cannot rescue me from this crocodile. My weeping wives are unable to save me in any way. Now I must take refuge in God, the supreme shelter. Only He has the power to save everyone from the greatest dangers, including death. Let me pray for His help. By the Lord's mercy, Gajendra could recollect a prayer he had learned in his previous life. He prayed, O Lord! You are the root cause of everything in the entire universe. You are its creator, maintainer, and destroyer. The entire universe is dependent on You. You are the shelter of all the great sages and devat\u0101s. I bow down to You. By Your divine energy, you can see everything. It's impossible to even for the great devat\u0101s and sages to understand You fully. Then how can an unintelligent animal like me understand You? Only selfless devotees who flawlessly practice bhakti can truly know You and attain You. In his prayers, Gajendra praised the general characteristics of the Supreme Lord but didn't call out to the name of any specific form ike Krsna, R\u0101ma, Var\u0101ha or Narasimha. He didn't know the identity of God. Yet, he described the qualities of the Supreme Person, whom he thought couid protect him. The elephant continued, O Lord, You appear in various incarnations in different jugas to protect Your devotees. Being extremely merciful, You liberate anyone who performs bhakti unto You. You stay within the hearts of all living beings and observe all their activities. My dear Lord! I do not wish to live anymore after being released from the jaws of this crocodile. What is the use of an elephant body covered with ignorance? I desire liberation. I only desire to attain You! Thus, Gajendra described various attributes of Lord Hari. The devat\u0101s like Brahm\u0101 and Indra also saw Gajendra's terrible situation, heard his prayers, and were capable of protecting him. But they didn't intend to do so because they thought, The elephant didn't call out our names, nor did he praise us. Instead, he glorified Lord Visnu's qualities. However, Vi\u015fnu doesn't come so easily. Thinking thus, they became indifferent to him. But Lord Hari is never indifferent toward the suffering of a devotee. Although Gajendra didn't call out a specific name of the Lord, all the qualities he described in his prayers were present in Lord Hari. So, the supremely compassionate Lord Hari hastily arrived on His mighty bird carrier, Garuda, to protect Gajendra. Noti ing this, the devat\u0101s thought, Oh, Lord Hari is going to save the elep ant. How unwittingly we thought that He wouldn't go to rescue Gajendra! Thinking thus, the devat\u0101s also went behind Lord Hari to the ikuta Mountain region. Seeing the all-attractive Lord Hari in the sky approaching him swiftly, Gajendra felt hopeful. Though he was reeling in severe pain, he picked up a lotus from the lake with his trunk and offered it to the Lord, praying, O N\u0101r\u0101yana! O, Supreme Master! I offer my heartfelt obeisances unto you. Pleased with Gajendra's devotion and concerned about his condition Lord Hari immediately sent His Sudar\u015bana cakra and severed the head of the crocodile. After that, all the devat\u0101s headed by Brahma and Siva praised Lord Hari while showering flowers. Then, the Gandharvas began dancing, singing, and playing various musical instruments. Interestingly, the crocodile turned into a handsome Gandharva. And Gajendra attained a form similar to the Lord - a bluish body with four hands and a charming face. Gajendra had been a great devotee of Lord Vi\u015fnu in his past life. Keen to know more about the crocodile and the elephant? Flip forward to rewind their lives.",

        "title": "The Two Curses",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 8",
        "story": "When the Sudar\u015bana cakra of Lord Hari beheaded the crocodile, the crocodile became freed of all sins and assumed a beautiful form of a Gandharva. He bowed before the Lord, circumambulated Him, and went to Gandharvaloka. In his previous life, the crocodile was a Gandharva king called H\u00fch\u016b. Once, he was bathing in a lake along with his wives. At that time, a great sage named sage Devala came to that lake to offer his prayers to the sun god. H\u016bh\u016b saw sage Devala and wanted to have some fun at his cost. He then swam towards the sage and dragged his leg within the water. The sage was disturbed in his prayers. He opened his eyes and saw H\u016bh\u016b doing the mischievous act. Devala became furious and said, O foolish Gandharva, you are behaving like a crocodile. May you become a crocodile. Having thus been cursed by the sage, H\u00fch\u016b said, O sage, please forgive me for my impudent act. Please relieve me of this curse. Seeing the king's repentance, Devala said, I cannot reverse the curse. But I can give you a blessing. When you become a crocodile, you will be slayed by Lord Visnu and thus be liberated. Due to this curse, H\u00fch\u016b became a crocodile and now was liberated by Lord Visnu. By the touch of Lord Hari, Gajendra was relieved from the crocodile's jaws, and was also liberated from ignorance. Gajendra then attained a similar spiritual form to that of the Lord, with dazzling yellow garments and four hands. This is called s\u0101r\u016bpya mukti. In his previous birth, Gajendra was a great king named Indradyumna, who ruled the glorious Pandya dynasty in South India. He was a great devotee of Lord Krsna. He exceptionally ruled his kingdom like the loving father of his citizens. When he grew older, he responsibly retired from family life and left for a sacred hermitage in the Malaya hills. With matted locks of hair, he performed severe austerities and lovingly worshiped Lord Hari. Once, Indradyumna accepted a vow of silence and started worshiping the Lord in full absorption. Suddenly a sage named Agastya arrived there along with his disciples. Seeing Indradyumna silently worshiping the Lord and not offering him a reception, Agatsya became angry and said, This king is not gentle. He is degraded and uneducated. He does not even know how guests must be welcomed. He has insulted a br\u0101hmana. May he become a dull and dumb elephant in his next life! Cursing Indradyumna in this way, Agastya left the place. Because of Agastya's curse, Indradyumna became Gajendra in his next life. Agastya's curse to Indradyumna was indirectly a boon that the Lord arraged. By the Lord's mercy, simply in one life as an elephant, Ind dyumna destroyed all his sinful reactions and was promoted to Vaikuntha. Although he got an elephant body that destroys memory due to his previous performance of bhakti, he still remembered His beloved Lord and the prayers he had learned. Thus, he offered prayers Lord Hari. who then arrived and took him to Vaikuntha. Lord Hari said, One who hears the story of Gajendra, early in the morning will become a great devotee and will be freed of all kinds of sinful reactions. After getting out of bed in the morning, one who chants this narration can counteract all the troubles of bad dreams. Anyone who offers Gajendra's prayers to Lord Hari early in the morning shall surely attain the spiritual world at the end of their life.",
        "quotes": "One should learn to respect great souls and not insult them.

That was the case with both the kings, H\u00fch\u00fc and Indrdyumna, who were cursed by sages but finally got the Lord's mercy. Whether something is a curse or a blessing depends on how one perceives it. Sometimes in the Bhagavatam, we see that even devotees are cursed heavily for their small mistakes. But those devotees accepted those curses as reactions to their own mistakes and didn't blame or hate anyone. Knowing nothing would happen without the Lord's sanction, they remained humble and content. They sincerely repented for their mistakes, avoided repeating them, and took the Lord's shelter heartily. Thus, they were ultimately liberated.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 8",
        "story": "Once in the celestial skies, Durv\u0101sa Muni saw Indra elegantly seated on the back of his heavenly elephant, Air\u0101vata. Being pleased to see the king of heaven, Durv\u0101sa respectfully offered him a garland that hung around his neck. A sage's gift is considered a blessing, but proud Indra didn't value it. So he took that garland and disrespectfully placed it on the elephant's trunk. Being an animal, Air\u0101vata couldn't understand its value and ignorantly smashed it under his feet. Durv\u0101sa Muni burst out furiously and said, Indra, you are so proud of your wealth. I curse you to become poverty-stricken. Soon after this incident, the asuras attacked the devat\u0101s and defeated them. All the devat\u0101s lost their positions. The wicked asuras took over the heavens and started tormenting innocent people. All this began with Indra's offense towards Durv\u0101sa Muni. The devat\u0101s couldn't find a solution to this problem. Hence they all went to the Sumeru mountain to meet Lord Brahm\u0101. They bowed down before Brahm\u0101 and informed him of their precarious situation. Seeing the distressful faces of the devat\u0101s, Bramh\u0101 spoke, We all must take shelter of Lord Visnu, for He is the source of everyone's strength. Being the all-merciful Lord, He will surely help us. Brahm\u0101, accompanied by the devat\u0101s, soon reached Sveta-dv\u012bpa, the spiritual abode of Lord Vi\u015fnu, which is situated in an ocean of milk. However, the Lord was not visible to the devat\u0101s. Brahm\u00e4 then offered prayers from the Vedas to please Lord Vi\u015fnu. He prayed, O Lord, although I am the creator of this universe, it's difficult for me to understand Your greatness. Please reveal unto us Your smiling face, We are in great difficulty. Please help us! Being pleased with the prayers of Brahm\u0101, Lord Vi\u015fnu appeared in front of the devat\u0101s. He was as brilliant as thousands of suns rising together. Blinded by His effulgence, the devat\u0101s couldn't even see Him. Then the Lord mercifully uncovered His effulgence and revealed His beautiful form. He had a beautiful blackish body that resembled a marakata gem. His eyes were reddish, like freshly blossomed red lotuses. His yellow silken garments resembled shining gold. His entire body was attractively decorated. A glance at His smiling face and eyebrows would destroy all of one's distresses. He was adorned with beautiful gem-studded necklaces and a Kaustubha Mani. An exquisite lotus garland adored His neck while He gracefully held the sharp Sudar\u015bana cakra and Kaumodaki Gada in His other hands. Seeing the beautiful form of Lord Vi\u015fnu, Brahm\u0101 spoke, O Lord, by seeing You, the long-desired goal of our life is finally achieved. You know everything that takes place in every corner of the universe. You are also aware of the troubles we are facing. Please show us how the devat\u0101s can regain their original positions. Lord Visnu could solve the devat\u0101s' problems at once, but He didn't do so. He desired to perform some enchanting pastimes. Therefore, He suggested to the devat\u0101s, It would be best if you make a truce with the asuras. Try to produce amrta (nectar). Cast all vegetables, grasses, creepers, and herbs into the milk ocean, and churn the ocean using Mandara Mountain as the churning rod and V\u00e4suki serpent as the churning rope. Shake hands with the demons, and with combined efforts, try to extract amrta. Anticipating the doubts in the minds of the devat\u0101s, Lord Vi\u015fnu said, Many products will emerge from the churning of the milk ocean. The asuras might demand them. Allow them to take those products without becoming greedy. Focus on your goal of obtaining amrta. It's difficult to deal with the demons, but with patience and peace, everything is possible. If you become distracted and frustrated, you won't be able to achieve your goal. Having thus advised the devat\u0101s, Lord Visnu disappeared. What will the devat\u0101s do now? Will they go to the asuras, their enemies, to make a truce? Will the asur\u0101s agree with their proposals? Flip the page to find out.",

Similarly, churning out amrta from the milk ocean was no cakewalk and was impossible without cooperation among those who were churning. Therefore, the Lord instructed the devat\u0101s to cooperate with the asuras, although their natures were opposite. Sometimes, we too may have to cooperate with someone whose opinion and working style differ from ours. But when we keep the higher goal in mind, keep aside our ego and envy, and adjust with tolerance, it becomes easy to work cooperatively with others.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 8",
        "story": "After receiving Lord Visnu's advice, the devat\u0101s approached Bali, the king of asuras. Bali was a great personality who could tactfully use peace-making and war. So when the devat\u0101s approached the asuras, some of the commanders of the asuras came forward to kill the devat\u0101s. But Bali stopped them, seeing the devat\u0101s not coming to fight but to discuss. The devat\u0101s approached Bali and spoke politely, Dear Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, we have a humble proposal. Both our camps can team up to churn the milk ocean and produce amrta (nectar). Then, both of us can share it among ourselves and become immortal. After contemplating Indra's proposal for some time, the asuras finally decided to befriend the devat\u0101s to obtain am\u1e5bta. Internally, the asuras had decided to churn the milk ocean with the devat\u0101s and later grab all the amrta only for themselves. But, of course, even the devat\u0101s had similar intentions. Thus, the two enemy parties now shook hands for churning the milk ocean. First, they went to the huge Mandara mountain, which was to be used as the churning rod. Then, with all their strength, they lifted the mountain and began carrying it towards the milk ocean. But because o its weight, they became very fatigued while on the way. Unable to Cry it any further, they suddenly dropped the mountain. As soon as the heavy golden mountain fell, the limbs of many devat\u0101s and asuras Vere crushed under its weight and thus broke. At that time, Lord Visnu appeared there on the back of Garuda. He revived the unconscious devat\u0101s and asuras just by His kind glance. Then He lifted the mountain and placed it on the back of Garuda. He also took all the devat\u0101s and all the asuras on Garuda! Elegantly seated, the Lord reached the milk ocean, and immediately told Garuda to leave the spot, after unloading the mountain. Then, the devat\u0101s and asur\u0101s summoned the great snake V\u0101suki. V\u0101suki coiled the Mandara Mountain like a rope, and the devat\u0101s and the asuras are supposed to hold the snake's front and rear portions to do the churning. Lord Vi\u015fnu then grasped the head of Vasuki, followed by the devat\u0101s. Then the asuras protested, The snake's front part is considered auspicious while the tail is inauspicious. We are very educated and qualified, so we musthold the front part, and you devat\u0101s hold the tail. Lord Visnu smiled at their demand and directed the devat\u0101s to hold on to V\u0101suki's tail. The devat\u0101s obediently followed. Finally, the two 'teams' began churning the milk ocean. But as soon as the churning began, the Mandara mountain started sinking into the ocean, because of lack of a supporting base! The devat\u0101s and asuras became anxious. Seeing this hindrance, Lord Visnu immediately expanded Himself into a mammoth tortoise, the magnificent K\u00fcrma avatara. Then Lord K\u00fcrma entered into the milk ocean. He effortlessly lifted and held the Mandara mountain on His gigantic back, 800,000 miles wide like a huge island. Encouraged by this, the devat\u0101s and asuras restarted their 'tug of war.' Lord K\u00fcrma experienced a nice, pleasing sensation with the mountain rolling on His back. Now, mustering all their strength, the two parties vigorously rolled the mountain and churned the ocean. After a while, they were all fatigued. V\u0101suki was almost dying due to the pain from his skin rubbing against the mountain vigorously. Seeing their condition, Lord Visnu desired to rejuvenate them. So ne re-energized the devat\u0101s with sattva-guna (mode of goodness), the asuras with rajo-guna (mode of passion), and Vasuki with tamo-guna (mode of ignorance). These three qualities of material nature enable different people with different mentalities to work differently. Thus, the Lord increased everyone's strength. Lord K\u016brma gave the stability to the mountain from bottom To also balance the mountain from the top and give it further steadiness, Lord Vi\u015fnu appeared in a humongous thousand handed-form, Sahasra-b\u0101hu, and held the top of the mountain with one hand. All the devat\u0101s offered Him eloquent prayers. Encouraged by the Lord's empowerment, everyone continued their hard work to obtain the amrta. They all vigorously churned for a long time. But soon, their energy was drained. Due to constant friction with the mountain, Vasuki's thousand mouths spat smoke and fire. The demons who were on the side of Vasuki's head appeared to be powerless. Even the luster of the devat\u0101s diminished. Once more, Lord Visnu helped the hard workers by arranging for cool breezes and cold showers falling from rain clouds above, which relieved them of all fatigue. When the amrta, didn't appear despite everyone's intense efforts, the Id decided to join in personally. The Lord looked extremely extra dinary while He partook in the churning. The ocean became turbunt, and all the aquatics, including fishes, sharks and whales, becare agitated. Finally, the first product of Samudra-manthana appeared. That was an extremely dangerous poison called h\u0101l\u0101hala. This toxic substance began spreading in all directions in the universe. Feeling unsheltered, everyone grew fearful! What would they do now? Who would come to their rescue? Will Visnu save them now as well, or someone else?",
        "quotes": "In this material world, there is a cheating mentality everywhere, even in heaven., Demoniac people naturally want to enter unnecessary competitions and prove themselves greater than others.",
        "trivia": "DID YOU KNOW? Why did Lord Vi\u015fnu ask Garuda to leave? Garuda being a mighty eagle, had the capacity to eat big snakes. But it was the snake V\u0101suki who would come there to play the part of the churning rope, and V\u0101suki would be the natural food for Garuda. DID YOU KNOW? Why do the waves of the ocean come out? Lord K\u00fcrma, who had entered the ocean, started breathing within the ocean. When He exhaled, the waves of the ocean came out of the ocean. And when He inhaled, the waves went inside the ocean. Since then, the ocean waves have continued to come out and go in.",
        "activity": "1. List all ways Lord Vi\u015fnu helped the devat\u0101s and the asuras in the churning of the milk ocean. 2. When the people whom you are working with are quarrelsome and always want to compete with you and dominate you, how will you deal with them?",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON SUPPORT: Without the Lord's inspiration, sanction, and support, none of our plans can take shape. As a gigantic tortoise K\u00fcrma, the Lord supported the huge Mandara Mountain from the bottom, and as the thousand-handed Sahasra-b\u00e4hu, He balanced it from the top. From conceiving the plan to churn the milk ocean up to its execution, it's the Lord's support that made this massive effort successful. Thus, even the devat\u00e4s in heaven always depend on the Lord for guidance and support. Understanding this, let's remind ourselves to humbly thank the Lord for His support and blessings in our endeavors.",

        "story": "The H\u0101l\u0101hala poison kept spreading in all directions. With no help in sight, the devat\u0101s decided to approach Lord \u015aiva for shelter. Although Lord Vi\u015fnu was undoubtedly competent to save the universe from the poison, He wished to give credit to His greatest devotee, Lord \u015aiva, and therefore abstained from doing so. Soon, all the devat\u0101s reached the pristine mountain Kail\u0101\u015ba where Lord \u015aiva was seated with his wife, Bhavani, only for the prosperity of the universe. The devat\u0101s then requested Lord \u015aiva, O Lord, please save us from this fiery poison. O Mah\u0101deva! We have come to you for your shelter because we know that you can easily destroy this poison. You are very powerful and benevolent. Glorifying his qualities, the devat\u0101s continued, At the time of destruction, you turn the entire universe into ashes just by the sparks of fire emanating from your eye. On the other hand, your presence brings flourishing happiness to everyone. Even Brahm\u0101 cannot estimate your greatness. Mature people worship you and appreciate your great character. But shameless fools criticize you and your wa lerings in the crematorium. Seeing the universe aggrieving due to the poison, Lord Siva became ve compassionate. He spoke to his wife, O Bhavani! Just see how the people have been placed into great danger due to this poison. It is my duty to protect them. Lord Vi\u015fnu will be very pleased when someone extends themselves for others' welfare. Therefore, let me drink this poison for the sake of all living beings. Fully aware of Lord Siva's powers, Bhav\u0101ni immediately agreed with his proposal. Then, powerful \u015aiva took every drop of the widespread poison into his palm and effortlessly drank it. That deadly beverage created a blue line on his neck, which he accepted as his ornament. This extraordinary act of selflessness by Lord Siva won the hearts of all great personalities, including all the devat\u0101s and even Lord Visnu. After Lord \u015aiva drank the poison, the devat\u0101s and the asuras resumed churning the milk ocean with renewed enthusiasm. Soon a majestic Surabhi cow appeared from the churning. This cow produced delicious milk, butter, and ghee and would be extremely helpful for Vedic sacrifices. Hence, the great sages accepted the cow as theirs. After further churning, a moon-white horse named Ucchaisrava appeared and was taken by King Bali. Then, a white elephant named Airavata appeared and was given to Indra. Further, precious jewels like the Kaustabha-mani and Padmar\u0101ga-mani appeared and decorated the chest of Lord Vi\u015fnu. Finally, after many such products, goddess Lak\u1e63m\u012b magnificently appeared from the churning. Her extraordinary beautiful features, youth, and complexion delighted everyone's minds. Who would have Goddess Lak\u1e63m\u012b as their possession? Read the next chapter to find out.",

Such people are endearing to the Supreme Lord and can easily attain the spiritual world. The best example of such a person is Lord \u00c7iva. We may not be able to mirror his selflessness at once, but by drawing inspiration from him, we can surely begin cultivating selflessness in the soil of our hearts.",

        "story": "When the divine goddess of fortune, Laksmi Devi, appeared from the Samudra Manthana, various personalities offered her several gifts, desiring her wealth in return. Indra, the heavenly king, offered her a gem-studded throne. The lovely cows offered her Pancha-gavya (a combination of five products: milk, curd, ghee, urine, and cow dung). Great learned sages performed an exquisite abhi\u015feka for Mother Laksmi. The Gandharvas sang melodiously while the apsaras danced in joy. Sarasvati Dev\u012b, the goddess of learning, offered a majestic necklace, while Lord Brahm\u0101 presented her a pink lotus flower. Adorned with lotus garlands and fine necklaces, Laksmi Devi walked about to find a suitable match for her. Then, smiling bashfully, she walked on while her cheeks were covered with long, shining earrings. Her golden form looked as beautiful as a creeper of gold. Accepting the ocean-god as her father, Mother Laksm\u012b, scrutinizingly examined the Gandharvas, Asuras, Siddhas and all the notable personalities present. Durv\u0101sa Muni was endowed with great austerity but occasionally lost his temper. B\u1e5bhaspati, the guru of the devat\u0101s, was like a treasure of knowledge, but he had many material attachments. Brahm\u0101 was very exalted, but he had many ambitious desire Indra had a great position, but sometimes that would become the case of his pride. In the way, Mother Lak\u1e63m\u012b examined different personalities but found that one of them was a flawless match. So, finally, she came to Lord Visnu the Supreme personality present there. After deep scrutiny, goddess Laksm\u012b concluded that Lord Visnu was an ocean of flawless qualities. Completely self-satisfied, He didn't even want beautiful Lak\u1e63m\u012b as His wife. But being attracted by His qualities, Laksmi wanted to have Him as her husband. So, she placed her garland on His neck and shyly waited for His response. Pleased by Mother Laksmi's devotion for Him, Lord Visnu accepted her at once. The devat\u0101s and their wives then made wonderful pompous arrangements for the divine marriage of Lak\u1e63m\u012b and Narayana in the presence of great personalities of the universe. Everyone was present, sang, and danced in ecstasy. Flowers flooded the Divine Couple while everyone praised Them eloquently. Thus, Lak\u1e63m\u012b and N\u0101r\u0101yana came to be known as the Supreme Parents of everyone. Lord Visnu is the father of the three worlds, and Mother Laksmi, who resides on His chest, is an ocean of unending mercy who increases the glories of all planets. After the marriage of Laksmi and Narayana, the devat\u0101s and the asuras continued the churning of the milk ocean. Then a lotus-eved goddess named V\u0101runi, who induces drunkards to get intoxicated, appeared to from the churning. Out of greed, the asuras immediately took possession of Varuni. After the appearance of Varuni, finally, as the churning continued, a divine young personality appeared from the milk ocean. He was exquisitely garlanded, heavily ornamented, and beautifully dressed in yellow clothes. He had a blackish complexion, long arms, and a broad chest. Carrying a jug of amrta in His hands, He looked extraordinary. He was none other than Dhanvantari, an incarnation of Lord Visnu. Lord Dhanvantari was the master of Ayurveda, or traditional medical science. As soon as the asuras saw Dhanvantari and the pot of nectar, they immediately snatched the pot from His hands, and ran away! The devat\u0101s helplessly watched this with disappointed faces. Would the asuras drink the nectar, not leaving a drop for the devat\u0101s? What would the devat\u0101s do now? Would they be bereft of their share of nectar, or would they snatch the amrta back?

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON WEALTH: Wealth is something that almost everyone in this world wants. While sinful people try to acquire wealth illegally, pious people worship the goddess Lak\u015fmi to attain wealth. Even great devat\u0101s worship her for prosperity. However, if one worships only Lak\u015fmi for material wealth and ignores her beloved husband N\u00e4r\u0101ya\u0146a, she wouldn't be pleased with such worship, and she doesn't favor the worshiper. Demoniac R\u0101vana desired to possess S\u012bt\u0101 Devi but envied Lord Rama. Proud Sisup\u00e4la wanted to marry Rukmi\u0146i Devi and envied Lord Kr\u015f\u0146a. But both Ravana and Sisup\u0101la met with misfortune due to their hatred for the Lord. Lak\u015fmi and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u0146a are a divine couple, our supreme parents. So, if we worship them together, we become recipients of Their profuse blessings.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 8",
        "story": "The asuras successfully snatched the amrta pot away from Dhanvantari's hand. But they were not successful in drinking the amrta. Soon they broke into a quarrel. Being selfish, each one wished to drink the nectar first before everyone else. Seeing the stronger demons entering disputes, the weaker demons proclaimed, Dear friends, even the devat\u0101s have helped produce this amrta. They should, too be given their rightful share. But, of course, the weaker asuras weren't so selfless to share the nectar with the devat\u0101s, but, seeing no other means to get their share, they wielded morality as a weapon. Seeing the asuras grab the nectar pot, the devat\u0101s plunged into disappointment. Finally, however, Lord Vis\u0146u reassured them. He then assumed the form of an exquisitely beautiful woman called Mohini-M\u016brti. Mohini-m\u016brti was beautifully ornamented with jewels and garlands. Divine aroma emanated from Her body. She moved from here and there as if searching for someone with Her restless eyes. Then, slowly, She reached the demons. As beary personified, She instantly mesmerized all the demons with Her ill ory potency. After all, She was Visnu, the master of maya. All the suras came under her magic and desired to befriend Her. Captivated by Her charm, they spoke thus, O lotus-eyed girl! Who are You? Your beauty and behavior have completely won our trust. Can you please bring an end to our fight and rightfully distribute the amrta amongst us? Smilingly, Mohini replied, O sons of Ka\u015byapa! I am not trustworthy, Please don't entrust Me with a task of such great responsibility. Hearing such words from Her, the mesmerized demons thought she was joking with them. So they repeated their request with complete confidence in Her. Again, Mohini-m\u00fcrti replied, If you accept whatever I do, whether right or wrong, only then will I take charge of this nectar distribution. The demons foolishly agreed to Her proposal, trusting Her completely. Each one of the demons thought that She loved him more than the others. Eventually, Mohini-m\u016brti agreed to distribute the nectar. Thereafter, dressing in beautiful clothes and ornaments, the devat\u0101s and the asuras assembled, eager to partake of the nectar. Mohini-m\u016brti came before them dressed in a beautiful sari, golden anklets, and earrings. She carried the pot of amrta in Her hands and walked gracefully with a smile on Her face. Mohini-m\u00fcrti then started her nectar distribution. The demons eagerly awaited Her merciful glances. However, She refrained from giving the nectar to the asuras. All of them were like crooked snakes; giving nectar to them would be as dangerous as feeding milk to a poisonous snake. Mohini gave the nectar to the devat\u0101s and freed them from old age. Looking at this, the asuras thought to themselves, Maybe Mohini-m\u016brti giving am\u1e5bta to the devat\u0101s before us to pacify them. After giving them a little, She will give us more nectar. Let the restless devat drink the amrta first; meanwhile, we will fill our minds with the grater nectar of Mohini Murti's charm. We don't want to quarrel with a woman. We want to please Her. Honoring their promise to Mohini-m\u016brti earlier, the asuras kept silent. They had developed love, affection, and respect for Her and she didn't want to disturb that relationship. Seeing the asuras, Mohini-m\u00fcrti indirectly indicated, The devat\u0101s are excessively anxious to take the nectar first. Let them have it now. Since you are noble and great, please be patient and wait a little longer. All the asuras came under the magical spell of Mohini-m\u00fcrti and kept quiet. But one asura named Rahu became greedy to drink the amrta. Disguising himself as a devat\u0101, he entered their assembly. Mistaking him to be a devat\u0101, Mohini-m\u00fcrti offered R\u0101hu some am\u1e5bta as well. Just as R\u0101hu was about to gulp it, the Sun god and the moon god realized he was an asura. Hurriedly, they informed Mohini-m\u016brti about this. Mohini-m\u00fcrti, at once cut off Rahu's head with the Sudar\u015bana-cakra, even before the nectar could flow down his gullet! After having thus distributed all the nectar amongst the devat\u0101s, Lord Visnu withdrew His woman form as Mohini-m\u016brti. He then mounted on Garuda and left for His abode Vaikuntha. All the devat\u0101s felt joyful, and the asuras were shocked! The asuras understood that Lord Visnu had cheated them. How would the angry asuras avenge this trickery? Would they attack the devat\u0101s and kill them? Read on to find out.",

It may seem so, but in truth, it isn't. Consider this example: A good teacher appreciates a disciplined student and scolds a mischievous student. This difference in treatment is not due to the teacher's partiality but a natural response toward the students' attitude and behavior. Similarly, although the Lord is equal to all, He is more inclined to His obedient devotees and punishes the miscreants. He is not partial to anyone but reciprocates with peoples' moods and deeds. Ultimately whether the Lord protects or punishes, He remains everyone's Supreme well-wisher.",

        "story": "Deprived of their share of ampta and feeling thoroughly cheated by the devat\u0101s and Lord Vi\u015fnu, the asuras grew very angry and intolerant. Filled with hatred, they picked up their dangerous weapons and marched toward the devat\u0101s to fight. The devat\u0101s, who were just empowered by the amrta counter, attacked the asuras in a great fighting spirit. A hair-raising battle took place on the serene banks of the milk ocean. Both armies fought ruthlessly with deadly weapons. The battlefield was thudding with the sounds of conch-shells, bugles, and drums. The king of demons, Bali, sat on an invisible airplane equipped with powerful weapons and constantly terrorized the devat\u0101s' army. But, on the other hand, King Indra sat on his majestic Air\u0101vata elephant, surrounded by several warriors, fighting fiercely. Within no time, the battlefield was crowded with dead bodies. Due to the trampling of both parties, dust rose violently in all directions, covering outer space with a dust cloud. Later, the dust could no longer float because of the blood that sprinkled down and sprayed up so high. King Bali began shooting arrows at Indra and his Air\u0101vata. However, even before Bali's arrows could touch him, Indra expertly counteracted them with his bhalla weapon. Seeing this, Bali became angry and shot his \u015bakti weapon, but again, even before Bali could leave his weapon, Indra cut it to pieces. In this way, Indra was constantly tormenting the demons. Finally, Bali resorted to demonic illusions. He created a giant mountain from which trees burnt in a blazing fire and sharp chips of stone smashed the heads of the devat\u0101s. That mountain also rained scorpions, snakes, lions, tigers, boars, and elephants that seemed to crush everything. Whirlpools, winds, and furious floods appeared on the battlefield. All the devat\u0101s became morose due to this mystical atmosphere created by invisible asuras. Unable to counteract the illusions, the devat\u0101s meditated on Lord Vi\u015fnu. Seeing His devotees in trouble, Lord Vi\u015fnu majestically appeared on the back of Garuda. Just by the Lord's presence, all the illusions were immediately vanquished. Seeing this, a cruel demon named K\u00e4lanemi, who was riding on a lion, threw his trident on Garuda's large head. But the all-knowing Lord caught hold of the weapon mid-air and killed K\u00e4lanemi by shooting back the same weapon he threw. Later, the Lord beheaded some prominent demons like M\u0101li, Sum\u0101li, and Malyav\u0101n with His potent Sudar\u015bana cakra and left the battlefield. In this way, the devat\u0101s were revived by Lord Visnu. Then they started destroying the very demons who were trying to destroy them. Indra took his powerful thunderbolt to kill Bali. Seeing their leader in trouble, all the demons were worried. While releasing the weapon, Indra rebuked Bali, You rascal! Just as a cheater blindfolds a child and takes away all his belongings, you are trying to defeat us with your mystic powers. But understand that we are the masters of all the childish powers you are demonstrating. Wait for my thunderbolt; today, I will finish you off! In response to Indra's offensive words, Bali said, Indra, don't speak arrogantly. Whatever results one attains are according to one's destiny. But out of ignorance, you consider yourself to be the cause of your victory. Because Bali's rebukes were truthful, Indra couldn't say anything. However, he continued to fight. Indra released his brahm\u0101stra at Bali. Then, at once, Bali fell from his airplane and was severely injured. Seeing Bali fall, Jambh\u0101sura, seated on a lion, came to help him. He attacked Indra and hit Air\u0101vata with his club. The mighty elephant became unconscious. Then Indra's charioteer M\u0101tali brought a chariot drawn by thousand horses and asked his master to sit in it. Impressed by M\u0101tali's timely service, Jambh\u0101sura attacked M\u0101tali with a blazing trident. Countering Jambh\u0101sura's attacks, Indra finally killed him with his Vajra weapon. Then a demon named Namuci came there. Roaring like a lion lion, he released a huge spear at Indra. However, just as one cuts vegetables into tiny pieces, Indra slashed the huge spear into pieces. He then attacked Namuci with his thunderbolt, which couldn't even slightly pierce Namuci's skin. Indra was astonished.  Then suddenly, an unembodied mystical voice spoke to Indra, Namuci cannot be killed by anything dry or moist. Think of another way to kill him. Indra began thinking deeply about the message for some time. Finally, the solution struck him! He decided to use a weapon made of foam, which was neither dry nor moist. At once, this foam weapon killed Namuci. The sages praised Indra for his sharp intelligence. In this way, Indra and the other devat\u0101s started killing the asuras just like a lion would kill a deer. Seeing the imminent destruction of all the demons, Lord Brahm\u0101 sent N\u00e4rada Muni to stop the fight. N\u0101rada Muni at once appeared and told the devat\u0101s, Dear devat\u0101s, all of you are protected by Lord Vi\u015fnu. Additionally, you have received the am\u1e5bta and thus became powerful. Now please stop fighting. There is no need to kill all the asuras. Hearing the advice of the respectable sage, the devat\u0101s stopped fighting and returned to their heavenly planets. What would the asuras do now? Would they keep silent and avoid fighting or raise their arms again? Flip the page to find out.",

        "story": "After the devat\u0101s went to the heavens, Narada Muni approached the demons. He urged them to take King Bali for urgent medical treatment. Then the demons immediately took Bali to the Astagiri hill, where their guru \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya resided. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya then used his renowned Sanj\u012bvini mantra and brought Bali back to life. He also revived all the other dead demons to a stable health condition. After King Bali became conscious, he didn't lament the lost amrta or the defeat at the hands of the devat\u0101s. Being very mature and experienced in life, he knew that nothing could take place without the sanction of the Supreme Lord. Grateful to his guru \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, he started to render faithful service unto him. \u0160ukr\u0101c\u0101rya and the brahmana descendants of the Bhrgu dynasty became pleased with Bali's service and offered his profuse blessings. They also made a sacrifice called Vi\u015bvajit yaj\u00f1a to empower Bali to conquer the devat\u0101s. From that yaj\u00f1a, Bali received a celestial chariot, a bow, two quivers, and armor. In addition, Bali's celebrated grandfather Prahl\u0101da gave him special blessings. Equipped with all this military paraphernalia and blessings, Bali decided to attack the city of Indra. He marched toward heaven with thousands of soldiers, weapons, and chariots. It seemed as if he was making the entire planet tremble. The heavenly kingdom was very beautiful, for it was filled with lovely gardens, fine fruit trees, chirping birds, and singing bees. Constructed by Vi\u015bvakarma, the city boasted lavish palaces decorated with golden doors and marble carvings. Moreover, the entire kingdom had breezes that carried the fragrance of flowers. Then Bali powerfully blew the conch shell that his guru gave. The thundering sound frightened everyone in heaven. Then Bali attacked Indra's city from all directions with his brave soldiers. Just recently, all the devat\u0101s had defeated the demons, but when the devat\u0101s saw the demons in such courageous spirits, they were surprised. Indra then went to his guru Brhaspati and asked, Our old enemy Bali has come back with renewed enthusiasm and astonishing power, which we cannot resist. He seems to be devouring us. Please tell me, what is the cause of his strength? B\u1e5bhaspati said, Dear Indra, the cause of Bali's power is the blessings of his guru and the brahma\u0146as. They were pleased with his devotion and blessed him with great power. It is their power, not Bali's power. Indirectly, B\u1e5bhaspati hinted to Indra that he was also powerful like \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101raya and if the devat\u0101s had served and pleased him with devotion, he would also bestow such power upon the devat\u0101s. Brhaspati continued, No one can stand before Bali except the Supreme Lord Vi\u015fnu. Right now, Bali and all the asuras are very powerful, and you do not have the strength to oppose them. Therefore, you all have only one way out. You should leave heaven and hide somewhere else until the situation of your enemies is reversed. Thus advised by Brhaspati, the devat\u0101s had no option but to leave heaven. Then they disguised themselves and slyly departed. Realizing that the devat\u0101s had wilfully left heaven, King Bali brought the entire heaven under his control. All the demons now ruled the three worlds. The brahmanas of the Bhrgu dynasty encouraged Bali to perform hundred A\u015bvamedha sacrifices to keep his position as the king intact. Thus, Bali gained a great reputation and enjoyed his rule due to the br\u0101hma\u0146as' blessings. Will Bali rule the three worlds forever? What happened to the escaped devat\u0101s? Will they continue to wander in disguised forms without any shelter? Or will they regain their kingdom by defeating the demons? Read on to find out.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 8",
        "story": "Knowing that the devat\u0101s were deprived of their positions in heaven, their mother, Aditi, lamented for them. After a long time, Kasyapa Muni, the husband of Aditi and the father of all the devat\u0101s, came out of his sam\u0101dhi or deep meditation. When he met Aditi, he felt that she was in a dull mood. With great concern, Ka\u015byapa asked Aditi, My dear wife, why are you looking so sad? Have you not properly received uninvited guests at our home? Homes from which guests go away without being received, even with an offering of little water, are like holes of jackals. Are you in the anxiety of separation from me? Are your sons happy? Your withered face shows that your mind is not peaceful. Aditi replied, Everything is well regarding my household duties and guest reception. Because I always follow your instructions, I cannot neglect dharma. My only concern is for my sons, the devat\u0101s. They are deprived of their positions in heaven because the demons have occupied their positions. As a result, my sons are now wandering in disguise. Please help them regain what they have lost. Sympathetic to Aditi's affection for her children, Ka\u015byapa Muni said, Dear Aditi, you must worship Lord Visnu. Only He is capable of subduing all enemies. If He is pleased by you, then undoubtedly, all your wishes will be fulfilled. Aditi felt hopeful and asked, Please tell me the method of worshiping Lord Vi\u015fnu and save my sons from this precarious situation. Ka\u015byapa Muni replied, I shall explain to you the same process Lord Brahm\u0101 had taught me when I desired a son. This is called the Payo-vrata process of worshipping Lord Visnu. In the bright fortnight of the Ph\u0101lguna month, for the twelve days till Dv\u0101da\u015bi, one should subsist only on milk and worship the lotus-eyed Lord Vi\u015fnu with unalloyed devotion. Then, you should perform your daily spiritual duties, offer various prayers to the Lord. Finally, you should chant the dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101k\u1e63ara mantra - om namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya. Aditi listened carefully, and Ka\u015byapa Muni continued, Offer garlands, incense, and lamps to the Deity, bathe Him with milk, and dress Him nicely. During these twelve days, avoid all material talks, remain free from envy and keep yourself pure. Distribute pras\u0101da to the brahma\u0146as and poor people. The Lord will soon be pleased with you and fulfill your desires. Thus, advised by Ka\u015byapa, Aditi strictly followed the Payo-vrata without any laziness. After Aditi successfully completed the Payo-vrata for twelve days, Lord Vi\u015fnu appeared in front of her in a four-handed form. Seeing Him, Aditi was overwhelmed with bliss. She stood up to offer prayers, but couldn't, due to her intense emotions. Tears fell from her eyes. Finally she gained composure and started offering prayers to the Lord with great love. She appeared to drink the Lord's beauty with her eyes. She prayed, My dear Lord! You're the master and protector of Your devotees. Your feet are the shelter of all holy places. Being the all-knower, You are already aware of my desires. If You are pleased by my service, please show me Your mercy! Lord Visnu replied, Dear Aditi, I already understood your long-cherished desire for the welfare of your sons, who were deprived of all the opulence by the asuras. Lord Visnu continued, O mother of the devat\u0101s! Your sons will surely be back in their lost positions. But at this moment, the asuras are unconquerable because they have been favored by the brahmanas, who are in turn favored by Me. Therefore, trying to fight against them will not be beneficial. Yet, I will surely favor you. I shall take birth as your son and thus protect the devat\u0101s. Till then, you may worship your husband Ka\u015byapa, who is pure by his austerity. Always think of Me, and keep this secret, even if someone inquires. After thus blessing Aditi, Lord Vi\u015fnu disappeared, and Aditi became extremely jubilant. Soon the Lord entered Ka\u015byapa's mind and later into Aditi's womb. Knowing this, Brahm\u0101 offered his prayers, O Lord! All glories unto You! Your uncommon activities are very difficult to comprehend. You have appeared in the womb of Prsni previously and now in Aditi's womb. Several times You appear as the son of Your devotees only to please them and perform beautiful pastimes. Lord Vi\u015fnu then appeared from the womb of Aditi in a four-handed form. He wore exquisite yellow garments and held \u015bankha, cakra, gada, and padma. His complexion was just like an effulgent black pearl. Just by His divine appearance, He created auspiciousness and happiness in the entire universe. Then to please His parents, the Lord mercifully assumed the form of a small sweet br\u0101hma\u0146a dwarf named Vamana. Learned sages joyfully performed a sacred thread ceremony for Lord V\u0101mana. Many celestial beings and devat\u0101s made loving offerings to the Lord. Mother Earth offered Him a deerskin, while the moon god gave Him a huge staff called brahma-danda. Lord Brahm\u0101 gave Him a water pot, while Mother Sarasvati gifted Him a string of rudr\u0101k\u1e63a beads. Thus various prominent personalities like \u015aiva, P\u0101rvati, Brhaspati, and others offered Him various presentations. After the sacred thread ceremony, Lord V\u00e4mana heard that King Bali was performing an a\u015bvamedha sacrifice at Bhrgukaccha on the northern side of River Narmada. Naturally, V\u0101mana wanted to go there. What would happen when V\u00e4mana meets Bali for the first time? Read about the exciting meeting in the next chapter.",

        "title": "An Unusual Charity",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 8",
        "story": "Lord Vamana started walking towards the sacrificial arena of the King of asuras, Bali. While walking, the young boy's steps pushed the earth down at every step. When he reached the spot, the priests of Bali saw effulgent V\u00e4mana, who appeared like the rising sun, robbing everyone with His splendor. Everyone stood dumbstruck, stood up from their seats, and welcomed the young brahmana boy. King Bali became very happy to see V\u00e4mana and instantly developed deep devotion to the Lord. But he restrained his devotional feelings because he acted as the asura king. Nevertheless, it was natural for k\u1e63atriyas to honor the brahma\u0146as. So, Bali unhesitatingly washed Lord V\u0101mana's lotus feet and placed the water so collected on his head. Bali praised V\u00e4mana, My dear br\u0101hma\u0146a, I heartily welcome You. What can I do for You? By Your auspicious arrival today, our entire dynasty has been purified. Today my sacrifice has finally been completed. All my sins are destroyed by this water that has washed Your feet. The touch of Your divine feet has sanctified the entire earth. Intending to offer charity to the young br\u0101hma\u0146a guest, Bali said, It appears that You have come here to ask me for something. You may take whatever You want from me a cow, golden palaces, palatable food, horses, elephants, chariots, or anything else. Please ask me without hesitation. Lord Vamana was very pleased and satisfied by Bali's extraordinary reception and said, Dear King! Your words are truthful and excellent. Your advisors are the exalted br\u0101hma\u0146as from the Bhrgu dynasty, while your ancestors boast of the greatest Prahlada. I only want three steps of land to the measurement of My steps. I don't ask for anything else from you. Although you're the king of the entire universe and very generous, I don't want anything beyond my necessity. One who accepts charity beyond one's own needs will be entangled in sin. Considering little V\u00e4mana not very intelligent, Bali said, Dear br\u0101hma\u0146a! Being a mere boy with insufficient intelligence, You aren't aware of Your own needs. Although I can gift You an entire island, You're asking only for three steps of land! One who approaches me for something need not ask for anything more from anywhere or anyone Please ask me for whatever You want. Lord V\u00e4mana gently replied, Dear king, even all the enjoyment in the entire universe cannot satisfy a person with uncontrolled senses. Therefore, if I am not satisfied with the three steps of land, I will not be satisfied even with the seven islands on the Bh\u016b-mandala. Great kings ruled the entire earth, but they couldn't achieve satisfaction. Therefore, I only ask for three steps of land, for that will satisfy me. Bali Maharaj then smiled and said, All right! Please take whatever You like. Then he prepared himself to offer the charity that Vamana wanted. This alarmed his guru \u0160ukr\u0101c\u0101rya. Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya could recognize V\u0101mana as Lord Visnu Himself. To stop Bali immediately Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya spoke to him, Dear King, this br\u0101hma\u0146a boy who has appeared as the son of Aditi and Ka\u015byapa, is Vi\u015fnu Himself. He has appeared to support the devat\u0101s. The promise you have made unknowingly is very harmful to the asuras. This boy will take away all your land, wealth, and property and give it to Indra. How will you then live if you give Him everything in charity? While Bali silently heard his guru, \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya cited more reasons. He said, You will not even be able to fulfill your promise. You will then have to suffer in hell. Now, if you have to go to hell by giving everything, isn't it better to keep everything to yourself and enjoy it? A charity that endangers one's livelihood is not praiseworthy. One should use one's wealth for dharma but also keep aside some wealth for one's family welfare. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya concluded, Take back your promise! A promise is truthful only when preceded by the word om. Therefore, don't worry. One may speak lies in certain situations like protecting one's wealth or saving someone's life. After hearing his guru's advice, Bali thought about it for some time. Then he replied, Dear guru, what you have spoken is true. A householder should have a means of livelihood and should not give up his duty of family maintenance. But I am the grandson of Prahlada. How can I withdraw my promise out of greed for money? How can I cheat a br\u0101hma\u0146a? I have already promised Him that I will give Him three steps of land. There is nothing more sinful than untruthfulness. Mother Earth can bear any heavyweight except the burden of a liar. I do not fear poverty, distress, or even hell, as much as I fear cheating a br\u0101hmana. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya didn't seem to agree with Bali. Emphasizing his decision, Bali continued, Wealth is anyway temporary and is separated at the time of death. So why not please a br\u0101hma\u1e47a with that wealth I'm going to lose at the time of death? Many great men like Dadh\u012bci and Sibi sacrificed their own lives for others' sake. So why should I hesitate to give up this insignificant land to please this great br\u0101hma\u0146a? Time will destroy everything that we have except our reputation. If I develop a good reputation by offering my property to this br\u0101hma\u0146a as a charity, that would be more precious than my insignificant wealth. If becoming poverty-stricken by giving charity to the needy is excellent, then what to speak of giving charity to this knowledgeable br\u0101hmana? Over and above that, according to you, if this boy is Lord Visnu, then without a second thought, I vow to give Him whatever He wants. In this way, king Bali rejected the advice of his guru. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya became furious with Bali's reply and said, You consider yourself so learned that you disobey my order! Therefore, I curse you to become poverty-stricken soon. Inspired by Lord Vi\u015fnu, \u0160ukr\u0101c\u0101rya thus cursed Bali. Now, what would be Bali's response? Would he fall at his guru's feet and beg forgiveness? Would he withdraw the promise he made to Vamana? Or did he do as he had decided before his guru cursed him? Read the next chapter for an exciting episode.",
        "quotes": "A devotee who is determined to serve the Lord can reject anything or anyone that creates an obstacle in one's service.",
        "trivia": "DID YOU KNOW? Why did \u0160ukr\u0101c\u0101rya stop Bali? \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya was a materialistic priest of the demons and didn't follow the principles of devotion unto God. If Bali became poverty-stricken, that would indirectly affect \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, as he depended on him for financial maintenance. Therefore he tried to forbid Bali. But Bali was very truthful in his promise and wanted to offer his wealth to Lord V\u0101mana even at the cost of being poverty-stricken. That's the nature of his pure devotion.",
        "activity": "1. What would you offer the Lord if He asked you for a gift? 2. Was Bali's disobedience to his guru proper? Explain. 3. If you were in Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya's place, would you allow Bali to offer charity to V\u0101manadeva or stop him? Why?",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON PROMISE: A truthful person never takes back his words, come what may. For a k\u1e63atriya like Bali, a promise made to a br\u0101hma\u0146a should be honored even if that means draining the royal treasury to the last coin. Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya warned Bali that the br\u0101hma\u0146a was indeed the Lord, who had come to take away all of Bali's property. He strongly advised Bali to withdraw his promise and tried inducing him to lie. But Bali was a man of his word and would not budge, although he represented the asura lineage. On similar lines, let's try our best to honor the promises we make. Also, let's think twice before making a promise, that is not simply mouth-deep but also heart-deep! A LESSON ON OFFERING: Factually, no one can give anything to the Lord for He is full in all aspects. What we offer the Lord is not charity but a service. Our offerings are not for His benefit, but for our benefit. What we offer to Him doesn't belong to us, nor does it enrich His opulence. But such an offering brings us closer to Him, by purifying our hearts. It's an expression of our devotion which is the very nature of the soul.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 8",
        "story": "Bali was prepared to give charity of three steps to Vamanadeva even after being cursed by his guru. He joyfully washed the Lord's lotus feet and then took that water on his head. Seeing this act of Bali, great Gandharvas, Vidy\u0101dharas, Siddhas, and Caranas praised him for his honesty and showered flowers upon him. After receiving the three steps from Bali, Lord Vamana manifested His divine pastime. V\u0101mana, a small br\u0101hma\u0146a boy, started increasing His size until everything in the entire universe was occupied. Seeing His gigantic form containing all the planets, skies, oceans, etc., everyone was awestruck. They began offering prayers. The devat\u0101s offered fragrant flowers while the Gandharvas and Apsaras joyously sang and danced for the Lord's pleasure. Lord Vamana covered the earth's entire surface in His first gigantic step. After that, his body covered the vast skies and His arms covered all directions. With His second step, He covered all the upper planets. Finally, his foot grew larger and larger and covered all the planets, including Satyaloka, Tapaloka, Janaloka, and others. Thus, the Lord didn't find any place for His third step! The effulgence of Lord Vamana's toenails even defeated the effulgence of Brahmaloka. Lord Brahm\u00e4, the sages like Marichi, and other great yogis seemed extremely insignificant. Various great personalities came to worship the Lord. The Lord appeared majestic when he occupied the entire universe with just two steps. This gigantic form of Lord V\u00e4mana is called Trivikrama, or one who has conquered all three worlds by occupying them with His own body. Brahma then worshipped Lord V\u0101mana's upraised lotus foot with the water from his pot (kamandalu). That water that washed the Lord's foot became River Gang\u0101. Falling down from the sky, Gang\u0101 purifies the three worlds. Lord V\u00e4mana, after occupying the entire universe with just two steps, then reduced to His original form. Seeing the Lord's bewildering feat, all the asuras became very angry. They complained, This V\u0101mana is not a br\u0101hma\u0146a, but Vi\u015fnu. He is the greatest of all cheaters who works only for the interests of the devat\u0101s. Our king embodies truthfulness and kindness towards the br\u0101hma\u0146as, so he will not punish this cheater. But we shouldn't let Vi\u015fnu take unnecessary advantage of our leader! It is our duty to kill this V\u0101mana and thus serve our master! The asuras then took up their weapons and rushed to kill V\u00e4mana. Lord Visnu's associates, Nanda, Sananda, Jaya, Vijaya, Garuda, Jayanta, and others, forbade them. Being as powerful as ten thousand elephants, they began trampling the asuras. Seeing Lord V\u0101mana's associates were killing the asuras, Bali told them, O Vipracitti! O Nemi! Please stop fighting! By human efforts, no one can defeat the all-powerful Supreme Lord. Time is also not in our favor. Previously, fate favored us, and we could defeat the devat\u0101s and occupy their heavens. Now, this same fate is in favor of the devat\u0101s. Therefore, we must wait till time favors us. By the influence of time, one can lose one's power, position, and everything. Better you all go to the lower planets now. Bali thus controlled the enraged demons. Garuda then came with the ropes of Varuna (varu\u0146a-p\u0101\u015ba) and arrested king Bali. Lord V\u00e4mana then spoke to Bali, O king! You had promised me three steps, but I occupied the entire universe with just two steps. Where should I put my third step? Being proud of your wealth, you promised to gift me three steps of land, but you couldn't fulfill your promise. One who doesn't give charity properly should go to hell. How would Bali respond to such allegations? Would he protest and speak against the Lord's cheating? What exactly were the Lord's intentions in treating Bali this way? Flip on to find out.",
        "trivia": "DID YOU KNOW? King Bali promised Lord V\u0101mana only the land occupied by his steps, but how can the Lord occupy the sky also? Steps include everything downward and upward. When one stands up, one occupies not only the land below one's feet but also certain portions of the sky. Thus, the Lord rightfully covered the entire skies with His huge steps. DID YOU KNOW? THE THREE GANG\u0100S 1. The water from Lord Brahm\u0101's pot that washed Lord Vamana's feet became River Gang\u0101. 2. River Gang\u0101 arose from the causal ocean, outside the universal shell pierced by Lord V\u00e4mana's toenail. 3. River Gang\u0101 is directly a liquid form of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u0146a. Thus, it should be understood that River Gang\u0101 is a mixture of all three.",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON CHEATING Great people cheat for a great cause. Although Lord Vamana cheated Bali, He did so for Bali's benefit. If a devotee is proud thinking of oneself as the proprietor of everything, the Lord takes his property away. This is to protect His devotee from illusion and pride and to show special mercy. By taking everything away from Bali, Lord Vamana allowed him to surrender himself fully. Later the Lord gave Himself to Bali, as we will see in the next chapter. Whatever God does is for our good. Thus, externally the Lord might seem partial or biased, but in reality He is our only well-wisher in all circumstances.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 8, 10",
        "story": "Lord V\u00e4manadeva seemed to have mistreated king Bali and made him break his promise. But Bali was not at all agitated. On the contrary, he was very patient and tolerant and said, O Lord! If you think my promise is faulty, I shall surely rectify it. So please place your third footstep on my head. I do not fear living in hell or losing my position. I do not fear being arrested or suffering from poverty. But I fear ill reputation. I don't want to be seen as a liar or become infamous for breaking my promise. Bali then expressed his heartfelt devotion and gratitude to V\u0101manadeva, My dear Lord! You are our eternal well-wisher. One's body, relatives, and home are all temporary. Only the service rendered unto You is permanent. Prahlada, my grandfather, was harassed by his father in many ways, yet You always protected him. I will also worship You, although You have taken away all my property. I only see this situation as an opportunity to surrender unto You. Your punishment will help me become detached from my temporary positions and possessions. While Bali was thus praying to the Lord, Prahlada appeared on the scene. Bali couldn't bow down to his grandfather because of being bound by ropes. He just offered him respect in his mind. Bali's eyes were filled with tears, and his face was lowered in shame. Bali thought, Because the Lord binds me, my grandfather might think that I have displeased the Lord. Seeing Lord Vamana, Prahlada was overwhelmed with tears of joy aid, My dear Lord! Lord! It is You only who has given heaven to Bali, and it is You only who has taken it away from him. In both situations, You are merciful towards him. While taking away his property and position, You have saved him from material illusion. This is just an act of your unlimited mercy. Then Lord Brahm\u0101 was about to say something, but Bali's wife, Vindhy\u0101val\u012b, arrived at the scene. So Brahm\u0101 allowed her to speak, and she said, O Lord! You have created this universe for Your pastimes. Unfortunately, however, foolish people claim proprietorship over it for enjoyment and consider themselves the doers of all their activities. Prahl\u0101da and Vindhy\u0101val\u012b indirectly approved the Lord's punishment to Bali, who was slightly proud of his wealth and charitable nature. But Lord Brahm\u0101 became sympathetic to Bali. Brahma then spoke to Lord V\u0101mana, O Lord! You are the well-wisher and master of all. Please release Bali. He doesn't deserve to be punished anymore. He offered You everything he had, including his own body! You are supremely pleased when anyone offers you a small flower or little water with love. By Your mercy, they attain Vaikuntha, then what to speak of Bali who has offered You the three worlds, without duplicity. How, then, can he deserve to suffer from arrest? Please release him. Please be merciful upon him. Finally, Lord V\u00e4mana spoke, revealing His heart, I favor My devotee who is proud of material wealth by taking away all his wealth. Despite possessing high birth, youth, beauty, education, opulence, and wealth, if one is not proud, such a person is understood to be favored by Me. Then the Lord began praising Bali and expressed His deep affection, I am very much pleased with Bali's tolerance. He has surpassed m\u0101ya. He is fixed up in his vow despite being bereft of his riches, fallen from his position, defeated and arrested by his enemies, rebuked by his relatives, and cursed by his guru. He remained tolerant and unagitated. Lord V\u00e4mana thus glorified Bali, and blessed him, Dear Bali, in the next manvantara, you will become Indra, the king of heaven. Until then, you may live on the Sutala planet, which is not obtainable even by the devat\u0101s. I am offering this to you, being impressed with your devotion. And I will personally become your gatekeeper at the Sutala loka. I will stay awake to protect you from any attacks by envious people. I bless you to remain devoted to Me even amidst distracting opulence. Bali was then released from the Varuna-p\u0101\u015ba. He became overwhelmed with the Lord's blessings and kindness. Folding his hands, with tears in his eyes, he spoke, O Lord, I merely offered obeisances to You within my mind when You came to me. Yet I attained results sought by fully dedicated devotees. The rare mercy You have shown me by putting Your foot on my head was not achieved even by the devat\u0101s. Saying this, Bali bowed down to the Lord and the other devat\u0101s like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva and joyfully went to Sutala, along with the asuras. Lord V\u00e4mana then spoke to Prahl\u0101da, My dear son! All good fortune unto you! For the time being, please go to Sutala planet and enjoy with your grandson and relatives. You will see Me there with a club in hand. Prahlada obediently followed the Lord's advice. Then, Lord Vamana gave the proprietorship of heaven to Indra and thus fulfilled the desire of mother Aditi. Lord Bramh\u0101, the devat\u0101s, the sages, the Manus, and everyone else glorified Vamanadeva as the protector of the universe. The Lord performed such astonishing acts only for the pleasure of Aditi and Ka\u015byapa and for the welfare of all living entities. The leaders of heaven brought Vamana to the heavens in a celestial airplane and then sang His glories. Everyone named V\u0101mana as Upendra, the younger brother of Indra. Anyone who hears the activities of Lord V\u00e4mana is undoubtedly freed from all sins. No one can count the glories of Lord Trivikrama, just as one cannot count the number of atoms on Earth.",
        "quotes": "The Lord gives the necessary intuition to His devotee to come out of a bewildering situation., Knowing the Lord to be one's true well-wisher, devotees always remain grateful to the Lord no matter however He treats them., If one becomes proud, thinking of himself as the proprietor of everything, the Lord takes away all of his wealth, only to protect him from pride and gift him the ultimate wealth of devotion., A pure devotee never deviates from the Lord's service despite all difficulties., The Lord takes great pleasure in serving His devotees., A devotee feels indebted and grateful to the Lord for His mercy.

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON SPECIAL MERCY: The Lord's mercy comes in different shapes and sizes. Although Lord V\u0101mana apparently cheated Bali earlier, He did so to free Bali of his slight pride. In reciprocation to Bali's surrender, the Lord showered upon Bali His affection by becoming his gatekeeper. Bali was not a sadhana siddha or one who becomes perfect by following various bhakti practices. Bali was a k\u1e5bp\u0101-siddha or one who becomes perfect by the mercy of devotees and the Lord. Because of the merciful blessings of Prahlada, Bali developed a deep devotion to Lord V\u00e4mana as soon as he saw Him and offered Him everything. Thus he attained the Lord's special mercy.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 8",
        "story": "Once upon a time, there lived a great King named Satyavrata. He ruled the Dravidade\u015ba during the Cak\u015fu\u015fa-manvantara. He was a great devotee of Lord Visnu. One day, King Satyavrata went to river Krtam\u0101l\u0101 to offer his oblations. He took some water into his hands and found a beautiful golden fish in his palms. He threw it back into the river, and again picked up some water from the river. The fish came back into his palms, and he threw it again into the water. To his surprise, the fish started speaking to the King. The fish said, O King, you're the protector of the poor, then why are you throwing Me in this river? I'm not safe in this river. I'm very much afraid of the big aquatics who can kill Me. Please give Me shelter. King Satyavrata was astonished to see the speaking fish. The king decided to protect the fish by agreeing to the fish's request. He brought the fish to his palace and placed it in a big water jug. Within one night, the fish grew so large that it could not fit in the jug. The fish then spoke to Satyavrata, Dear King, this jug is very congested for Me. Can you please give Me a better shelter? Then, the King kept the fish in a large well. But within a moment, the fish expanded in size and occupied the entire well. Satyavrata was surprised, and left it in a huge lake. But within no time, the fish assumed a form exceeding the extent of the lake and spoke to the Satyavrata, O King, this lake is not sufficient for Me to live in. Please put Me in a water reservoir that is big enough to accommodate Me. Even the largest reservoir of water wasn't sufficient for the fish. So, the King released the fish into the ocean. Then the fish said, O Satyavrata, there are so many dangerous sharks that will eat Me in the ocean. Please don't throw Me here. Bewildered, Satyavrata asked the fish, Who are you, sir? In one day, You expanded Your size so much that You couldn't fit in any of the vessels I provided. I have never seen such a miraculous aquatic before! By the Lord's mercy, King Satyavrata understood the fish's identityand said, You are certainly Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u0146a. I offer You millions of obeisances. To show mercy on all living beings, You have now assumed the form of an aquatic. All Your pastimes and incarnations are only for the welfare of all living beings. I wish to know the purpose of Your Matsya incarnation. Why did You appear in the form of a fish? Lord Matsya replied, Dear King, please hear Me attentively. On the seventh day from today, all three worlds (Bh\u016bh, Bhuvah, and Svah) will merge into the waters of devastation. The universe will be annihilated, and the three worlds will be submerged in the flooding ocean waters. During such chaos, I will send you a large boat. You should collect all types of herbs, seeds, and everything valuable and immediately stock them on the ship. Then, accompanied by the seven great sages (sapta r\u015fis) and all kinds of living beings, please board the boat. Afterward, attach the huge vessel to My horn using the Vasuki serpent as a tying rope. Then, in the light of the effulgence of the sages, travel on the dark ocean of inundation without fear. Pulling the boat, I shall travel in the waters of the devastation until Brahma's night slumber is over. Saying this, Lord Matsya disappeared. King Satyavrata was astonished to hear such news from the Lord. But maintaining his cool, the King began meditating on Lord Matsya while sitting on a ku\u015ba mat. After some time, heavy rains poured. The ocean began to overflow and inundated the entire world. Then, as foretold by Lord Matsya, Satyavrata saw a big boat coming towards him. He then collected all the herbs and creepers, and, accompanied by the sages; he boarded the boat. The sages spoke, Dear king, please meditate on the Lord, for only He can save us from this huge danger. Satyavrata then began meditating on the Lord. Suddenly, a large golden fish, eight million miles long, with a horn, appeared in the ocean. Following the Lord's advice, the King anchored the boat to the Lord's horn with the V\u0101suki serpent. King Satyavrata then offered his heartfelt prayers to Lord Matsya, \u039f Lord, You bestow knowledge upon the ignorant. You are our Supreme guru. Foolish people material activities hoping for happiness, but they only get suffering. Only by serving You can become free from all suffering, and attain eternal happiness. Neither the devatas nor the sages can understand You fully. You are the supreme well-wisher of everyone. Please be merciful upon us. Thus praised by Satyavrata, Lord Matsya explained spiritual knowledge while moving in the ocean. Lord Matsya taught him the Matsya Pur\u0101na and Sankhya yoga (analysis of matter and spirit). King Satyavrata and the sages were blessed to hear Lord Matsya's instructions. Anyone who sincerely hears this great divine narration is freed from all sins. Satyavrata, in his next life, became the son of the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n. Therefore he was called Vaivasvata Manu.

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "Initially, Vaivasvata Manu did not have children. To get a son who would rule the kingdom after him, he conducted a sacrifice under Vasistha Muni's guidance. During the sacrifice, his wife, \u015araddh\u0101, observed the Payo-vray\u0101 vow, subsisting only on milk. Although Manu desired a son, his wife desired a daughter. So, she approached the priest and requested him for a daughter. The priest then offered oblations into the fire to get a daughter for the Queen. Eventually, \u015araddh\u0101 gave birth to a beautiful daughter named Il\u0101. Vaivasvata Manu was happy with her birth, but his desire for a son remained. So, Manu went to Vasistha Muni and asked, Dear sage, you br\u0101hma\u0146as are sinless, austere and are experts in chanting mantras. So then, how was the result of the sacrifice opposite? Why did I get a daughter instead of a son? Vasistha replied,This discrepancy in the sacrifice was due to your priest. He chanted mantras so that you get a daughter instead of a son. But don't worry, I can give you a son. Sage Vasistha then offered prayers to Lord Visnu to transform Il\u0101 into a boy. Being pleased, Lord Vi\u015fnu granted Vasistha's desire, and thus Il\u0101 became a handsome boy named Sudyumna. Sudyumna grew up nicely as a prince. He went to the forest to hunt with his followers one day. While chasing the animals, he entered a forest named Sukum\u0101ra, where Lord \u015aiva stays with his wife, Um\u0101. As soon as Sudyumna entered that forest, he immediately transformed into a female. Even his followers also became females. Everyone was confused. Even Sudyumna's horse became a mare! Sudyumna, having been transformed into a beautiful woman Il\u0101, began loitering in the forest along with his soldiers, who also became a woman. At that time, Budha, the son of the moon god, saw Ila and became attracted to her. Budha then married ll\u00e4 and got a son named Pur\u016brav\u0101. Later, Sudyumna (Il\u0101) remembered his guru Vasistha. Vasistha came and saw his miserable condition. Earlier, Vasistha transformed Il\u0103 into Sudyumna, and now because of entering into Sukum\u0101ra forest, Sudyumna again became Il\u0101, a female. So Vasistha worshipped Lord \u015aiva to transform Il\u0101 into Sudyumna again. Pleased with Vasistha, \u015aiva appeared before him and said, Sudyumna may remain a male for one month and female for the next month. Thus, Sudyumna regained maleness every alternate month and ruled the kingdom, although his citizens were not satisfied. Finally, after thus ruling for some time, Sudyumna retired and gave the entire kingdom to his son Pur\u00fcrav\u0101. Later, Vaivasvata Manu had more sons. Who were they? What were their stories? Flip the page to find out.",
        "trivia": "DID YOU KNOW? THE STORY OF SUKUM\u0100RA FOREST: Once, some sages came to see Lord \u015aiva in the Sukumara forest. At that time, Lord \u015aiva was his wife, Parvati. Uma felt shy and uncomfortable seeing the sages, and the sages immediately departed. Knowing the embarrassment of Parvati, Lord \u015aiva said, Dear Parvati, any male who enters this forest shall immediately become a female henceforth. Since then, no male has entered the forest.",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON FATE: Sudyumna's father desired a male child, while his mother desired a female child. Then Sudyumna was first born as a girl, became a boy, and again became a girl. After that, he remained a girl for one month and a boy for one month. The nature of this world is that, despite one's desire, determination, and endeavor, one cannot change one's destiny so easily. But there is a way to escape destiny, too that is the path of bhakti. Only bhakti or devotion unto Lord Krsna or Vi\u015fnu can change the course of one's life, as seen in the following story.",

        "title": "Pr\u015fadhra: One who Surpassed a Curse!",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "After Sudyumna retired, his father, Vaivasvata Manu, wanted more sons. He then performed severe austerities on the bank of River Yamuna for 100 years. He worshipped Lord Visnu and thus obtained ten sons. One of them was Pr\u015fadhra. Vasistha Muni instructed Prsadhra to take care of the cows. Following his guru's order, Pr\u015fadhra would stand all night with a sword to protect the cows from ferocious animals like tigers and lions. One day, a tiger entered the cow shed during the night. At that time, the stars were covered by clouds. Everything was dark. All the cows became scared and started running here and there. The tiger roared and caught one cow, who screamed in distress. Prsadhra took up his sword and carefully followed the sound of the tiger and cow in the darkness. He wanted to cut the head of the tiger, but by mistake, he cut off the cow's head with his sword. The sword also cut off the tiger's ear, and the tiger fled in fear while bleeding. In the morning, Pr\u015fadhra realized that he had killed a cow, and felt very depressed and regretful. Although this sin was unintentional, guru Vasistha became very angry and cursed Pr\u015fadhra, May you take birth as a low-born \u015b\u016bdra in your next life, for the sin of killing a cow. Vasistha could have suggested a process of atonement for Prsadhra's unintentional sin. But instead, he impulsively cursed Prsadhra. Accepting the curse with folded hands, humble Pr\u015fadhra did not protest or defend himself. Taking the vow of celibacy (brahmacharya), he just worshipped Lord Vasudeva with fixed devotion. Saintly Pr\u1e63adhra was detached, self-controlled, and satisfied with his knowledge and devotion. Thus, he traveled all over the earth, as if dumb, blind, and deaf, absorbed in devotional meditation to Lord Vasudeva. Once, while traveling, he entered a forest fire and left his body there. He thus attained Lord Krsna in the spiritual world. Although because of his karma (Vasistha's curse), he was supposed to take birth as a sudra in his next life, he avoided it by performing bhakti unto Lord Krsna. He escaped the effects of the curse.",
        "quotes": "Sometimes even great sages come under anger and overly punish someone for an innocent mistake.",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON DEVOTION: Pr\u015fadhra killed a cow unintentionally, yet he was harshly cursed by Vasistha to become a \u015b\u016bdra in the next life. But instead of becoming disappointed, Pr\u015fadhra accepted the curse and sincerely performed bhakti unto Lord Kr\u015f\u0146a. Eventually, he attained the Lord's abode instead of taking birth as a \u015b\u016bdra. That is the power of bhakti. One who seeks God's shelter remains unaffected by the reactions, curses, and sufferings of this world.",

        "title": "Sukanya: The Young Wife of An Old Sage",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "Vaivasvata Manu had another great-son named \u015aary\u0101ti. Moreover, King \u015aary\u0101ti had a beautiful daughter named Sukany\u0101. One day, \u015aary\u0101ti and Sukany\u0101 went to the a\u015brama of sage Cyavana, along with some soldiers. Sukany\u0101, who was very young then, started collecting fruits in the forest with her friends. Interestingly, she saw two glowing objects within an anthill. Out of curiosity, she went close to the anthill and innocently pierced the two glowing objects with a thorn. Suddenly, lots of blood started oozing from there. Sukany\u0101 grew fearful, and \u015aary\u0101ti became surprised. After that, all the soldiers of \u015aary\u0101ti felt constipated and couldn't pass urine. \u015aary\u0101ti then spoke to his associates, It appears that someone among us did something wrong and polluted Cyavana Muni's \u0101\u015brama. Frightened, Sukany\u0101 went to \u015aary\u0101ti and told them what she had done. After that, Sary\u0101ti became afraid and tried to appease Cyavana Muni, sitting within the anthill. Finally, \u015aary\u0101ti said, O great sage, please forgive my foolish daughter. She did it out of innocence. Cyavana Muni asked \u015aary\u0101ti, Is your daughter married? \u015aary\u0101ti understood Cyavana Muni's desire just by his question. So then, Sary\u0101ti said, No, my dear sage, my daughter is not married. But, if you desire, you can marry her. Cyavana Muni agreed. Sarv\u0101ti then got his daughter married to the sage and returned to his kingdom. Cyavana Muni was old and irritable. Sometimes he would unnecessarily get angry. However, Sukanya was endowed with great patience. She served her old husband carefully, understanding his temperament, and slowly conquered his heart. One day, the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras, the doctors in the heavens came to Cyavana Muni's \u0101\u015brama. Cyavana Muni greeted them and requested, You are great doctors in heaven. Can you please help me regain my youth? In return, I shall give you a pot full of soma-rasa, although you are ineligible to drink it. The A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras were experts in Ayurveda, just like Lord Dhanvantari. So, they could make an older man young. So, they happily accepted Cyavana Muni's proposal. They caught hold of the old and emaciated Cyavana Muni and entered a lake. After some time, three handsome men came out of the lake. When Sukany\u0101 saw three young men similar to each other, she was confused. It was clear that two of them were the A\u015bvini-kum\u0101ras and the third one was Cyavana Muni, but she couldn't recognize her husband because they all looked similar. She could have chosen any of them but only wanted her husband. Sukanya then requested the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras, O great devatas, please mercifully show my husband. Pleased with her chastity and honesty, the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras then revealed her husband, and returned to their heavens. Cyavana Muni thus became a young man and started staying happily with Sukany\u0101. Once King \u015aary\u0101ti came to Cyavana Muni's home, to perform a sacrifice. There, he found Sukany\u0101 with a young man he had never seen. Meanwhile, Sukany\u0101 came and bowed down to her father respectfully. Then \u015aary\u0101ti, instead of giving her blessings, spoke to her angrily, You have cheated your respectable husband, a br\u0101hma\u0146a sage. But, because he was old, did you accept this young man as your husband? \u015aary\u0101ti misunderstood Sukany\u0101 because he did not find the old sage but found a young man instead. But Sukanya, being very tolerant, smiled and spoke, My dear father, this young man is Cyavana Muni. By the grace of A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras, he became young now. Hearing the whole story from Sukany\u0101, \u015aary\u0101ti was surprised and happy and embraced his beloved daughter. Cyavana Muni then assisted to perform a soma-yaj\u00f1a and later he offered a pot full of soma-rasa to A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras. The devatas in heaven generally drink soma-rasa, a special beverage, but the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras, being just doctors on the heavenly planets, weren't qualified to drink it. But still, Cyavana Muni offered them this soma rasa. Knowing this, Indra came there angrily and took up his thunderbolt to kill Cyavana Muni. But Cyavana Muni, with his powers, paralyzed Indra's arm. After that, all the devat\u0101s agreed to allow the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras to drink the divine beverage.",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON PATIENCE: Sukanva committed the innocent mistake of piercing Cyavana Muni with a thorn. After marrying Cyavana, she treated him with love, respect, and patience, although he was old and irritable. When her father became angry seeing her with a young man, she patiently clarified to him that he was Cyavana. In this way, Sukanya showed great patience in her dealings instead of being impulsive and angry. Thus, she could win the heart of her husband and her father. If we, too, try to be accommodative to others' moods and deal with them patiently, we can build loving relationships with everyone around us.",

Brahm\u0101 smiled and told Kakudmi, Dear king, twenty-seven catur-yugas as you waited for me. Because the time calculations on the earth and higher planets are different. Presently, it is Dv\u0101para-yuga on the earth. I suggest you offer your daughter Revati to the most powerful Lord Balarama, who has now descended on the earth along with Lord Krsna.

Meanwhile, his brothers thought he wouldn't return to marry or rule the kingdom. So, they all divided their father's property amongst themselves. Later, when N\u0101bh\u0101ga returned, his brothers didn't give him any wealth. Instead, they slyly told him, Your share is our father. When simple-hearted N\u0101bh\u0101ga went to his father, his father said, Don't believe your brothers' cheating words. I am not a property that can be enjoyed. Innocent N\u0101bh\u0101ga didn't go back to his brothers again for his share of the property. So, his father felt pity on him and suggested a means of livelihood. Nabhaga advised N\u0101bh\u0101ga, The sages of the Angir\u0101 dynasty are going to perform a great sacrifice. Although they are learned, on every sixth day, they will make mistakes. Go to them and describe two Vedic mantras. After completing their sacrifice, they will give you the money they received in the sacrifice. N\u0101bh\u0101ga acted accordingly, and the sages gave him all their wealth. While N\u0101bh\u0101ga accepted the riches, a black person (\u015aiva) said, All this wealth belongs to me.

He utilized his body, mind, and words in Krsna's service while responsibly ruling his citizens like a father. He would conduct various sacrifices for the welfare of his citizens.

Ambar\u012b\u015fa respectfully welcomed Durv\u00e4s\u00e4 Muni and said, Dear sage, please honor meals at my home. Durv\u0101s\u0101 gladly replied, I shall surely eat at your home. But before that, let me go to Yamuna to bathe and perform my rituals. Saying this, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni left for Yamuna. Ambar\u012b\u015fa waited for Durv\u0101s\u0101's return, but in the meantime, the auspicious time during which he had to break his fast was passing by. So, Ambar\u012b\u015fa considered, If I break my fast before feeding Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, then that would be an offense to the brahma\u0146a guest. But if I do not break my fast and wait for Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, then that would be a flaw in my Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b vrata. So, let me drink a little water which would count as eating and not eating too. Thinking thus, King Ambar\u012b\u015fa drank a little water. After some time, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni returned from Yamuna, having completed his rituals. Ambar\u012b\u015fa welcomed him with respect. Durv\u0101s\u0101, by his mystic power, understood that Ambar\u012b\u015fa had drunk water. He became furious and criticized Ambar\u012b\u015fa, Alas, see the mentality of this cruel king! Intoxicated with wealth, he thinks of himself to be God. He had invited me as a guest, but before feeding me, he ate first. I shall now punish him for his misbehavior. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni created a fiery demon by uprooting a bunch of hair from his head. That demon resembling the blazing fire of destruction came before Ambar\u012bsa holding a trident. But Ambar\u012b\u015fa was not at all disturbed. He didn't even move slightly! Completely dependent on Lord Visnu, he thought, I should not counteract the power of a brahmana sage. I should tolerate his rage. While Ambar\u012b\u015fa was thus meditating on Lord, the Lord's Sudar\u015bana cakra suddenly appeared on the scene and burnt the fiery demon at once, just as a forest fire burns a snake. Then the Sudar\u015bana cakra started flying towards Durv\u0101s\u0101 at great speed to kill him too. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was frightened. To protect himself, Durv\u0101s\u0101 ran swiftly and entered a cave in the gigantic mountain named Sumeru. However, the Sudar\u015bana cakra continued to chase him even within the deep caves. Being a mystic yogi, Durv\u0101s\u0101 could go anywhere. He fled in all directions - in the sky, earth, caves, oceans, planets, and even the heavens. But wherever Durv\u0101s\u0101 went, the Sudar\u015bana cakra hunted him down. Finding shelter nowhere, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni went to Brahm\u0101loka, seeking Lord Brahma's help. Brahm\u0101 told him, Dear sage, I am fully dependent on Lord Vi\u015fnu. Myself, \u015aiva, Bhrgu, all the sages and devat\u0101s, surrender unto Him. I have no power to save you because you have offended Lord Visnu's devotee. When thus refused by Brahm\u0101, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni went to Kail\u0101sa to take Lord \u015aiva's shelter. Lord \u015aiva said, Dear Durv\u0101s\u0101, myself, Brahm\u0101, and all the devat\u0101s are always under the control of Lord Vi\u015fnu. We cannot compete with Him. Even great sages like N\u0101rada and Vy\u0101sa cannot understand His glories. So when He has decided to punish you, who are we to protect you? It's better that you go to Him for protection. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni then went to Vaikuntha and fell at the feet of Lord Visnu. Scorched by Sudar\u015bana cakra's heat, he spoke, O Lord Vi\u015fnu, O Ananta, O Acyuta, O Narayana, You're the well-wisher of the entire universe. Please protect me from this reaction. Lord Visnu said, Dear sage, I'm not independent. I am completely under the control of My devotees. They control My heart because their hearts are pure without any malice. What to speak of My devotee, even the devotees of My devotees are very dear to Me. I cannot enjoy all My opulence and position without My devotees. They give up their homes, riches, relatives, and lives to serve Me. How can I give them up? They are always satisfied in serving Me and are not interested even in liberation. They do not know anything else but Me. And I do not know anyone else but them. They're in the core of My heart, and I always stay within their pure hearts. Durv\u0101s\u0101: O Lord, if I have offended you, I fall at your feet begging forgiveness. Lord Vi\u015fnu: Not Me. Please go to Ambar\u012b\u015fa and beg for forgiveness. I will be pleased only when his heart is pleased. Durv\u0101s\u0101: O Lord, but can't You see his fault? He invited me but ate before feeding me. How can You tolerate an offense to a br\u0101hmana? Between respecting a br\u0101hma\u0146a and following the Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b vrata, which is more important? Lord Visnu: Durv\u0101s\u0101, you're so ignorant of the conclusions of scriptures. Go and ask Ambar\u012b\u015fa. He will teach you. The scriptures say that drinking water is both eating and not eating also. Thus, just by drinking little water, Ambar\u012b\u015fa has equally respected his brahma\u0146a guest and the Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b vrata. By offending Ambar\u012b\u015fa, you have acted with self-envy. Go and immediately fall at his feet for your own protection. Lord Visnu continued, For a br\u0101hma\u0146a, austerity and learning are certainly auspicious, but if he is not gentle and has bad conduct, his austerity and learning are of no use to him. Therefore, you should go to Ambar\u012b\u015fa and please him. Only then will you attain peace. Hearing Lord Vi\u015fnu's words, Durv\u0101s\u0101 immediately ran towards Ambar\u012b\u015fa and fell at his feet. Ambar\u012bsa felt ashamed to see a br\u0101hma\u0146a sage falling at his feet. Durv\u0101s\u0101 was about to get up and praise Ambar\u012b\u015fa, but Ambar\u012b\u015fa understood the situation and requested Sudar\u015bana cakra, O Sudar\u015bana, you're very dear to Lord Vis\u0146u. Your thousands of spokes can destroy all weapons. You're known to destroy demoniac people, but not the gentle br\u0101hma\u0146as. This br\u0101hma\u0146a sage is not your enemy. If our family has given any charity, performed sacrifices, properly carried out our duties, and pleased the all-merciful Lord, please, may this brahma\u0146a be freed. Because of Ambar\u012b\u015fa's prayers, Sudar\u015bana cakra became peaceful and stopped burning Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni. Being grateful, Durv\u0101s\u0101 praised Ambarisa, Today I have witnessed the greatness of Lord Visnu's devotees. O King, although I have offended you and tried to kill you, you have prayed for my life. What is impossible to do for pure devotees like you? I'm indebted to you. Ambar\u012b\u015fa had astonishingly fasted since the time Durv\u0101s\u0101 was being chased by Sudar\u015bana cakra. So, he requested Durv\u0101s\u0101, O sage, you had come to eat at my house one year ago. But I couldn't feed you. So please accept the food now. Durv\u0101s\u0101 then praised Ambar\u012b\u015fa, I'm very satisfied and pleased by your hospitality. Simply by associating with you, I am feeling very joyful. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni then happily ate in the house of Ambari\u015fa and requested him also to eat his meals. Later, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni departed for Brahm\u0101loka while praising Ambar\u012b\u015fa and his bhakti. Ambar\u012b\u015fa didn't take any credit for the protection of Durv\u0101s\u0101. All he knew was that the Lord is all merciful. After responsibly performing his kingly duties for a long period, Ambar\u012b\u015fa divided his property amongst his sons. He then retired to the forest and concentrated his mind fully upon Lord Vasudeva. With sincere and dedicated spiritual practices, he finally attained the spiritual world. Anyone who chants or even thinks about the narration of Ambar\u012b\u015fa Mah\u0101r\u0101ja becomes a pure devotee of the Lord.",
        "quotes": "A devotee balances his social and spiritual duties nicely., The Lord inspires His sincere devotees to take suitable decisions according to time, place and circumstances., Pure devotees are not afraid of danger because they always depend on the Lord., One's prowess employed against a devotee certainly harms the person himself., One who truly loves God naturally loves His devotees too. But one who is rude and offensive to the devotees is not a true lover of God., The Lord experiences pain in His heart when someone tries to harm His devotees., Devotees are willing to sacrifice everything they have to serve or save others., Sometimes tolerance and forgiveness can be more effective than weapons in transforming the heart of a proud and envious person., Devotees do not take credit for their benevolent actions. They transfer all glory to God and His mercy.",
        "trivia": "DID YOU KNOW? How Ambar\u012b\u015fa used all his senses in Krsna's service? Mind - Meditating on Krsna's lotus feet Words - Glorifying Krsna's qualities Hands - To clean Krsna's temple Ears - Hearing narrations about Krsna Eyes - Seeing the deities of Mukunda Sense of touch - Touching devotees Nose - Smelling the fragrance of Tulas\u012b Tongue - Tasting the Lord's pras\u0101da Legs - Walking to holy places & temples Head - Bowing to the Lord's feet",

If forgiveness is a godly quality, then why does the Lord punish the demons? Can't He forgive them? Explain.",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON FORGIVENESS: Although a devotee doesn't take offenses seriously, the Lord does not tolerate any offense against His devotees. Therefore, offenses against a devotee are very severe. Mature devotees readily forgive any offender, but the offender must give up his false ego and sincerely beg forgiveness from the devotee. Only then will the Lord excuse the offender. Devotees are so forgiving that they are willing to go to any extent to save the offender, and they don't even take credit for their kindness. They attribute all credit to the Lord. They hold no grudges, envy, or negativity towards the offenders. Forgiveness makes one's heart peaceful, brings a transformation in the offender's heart, and ultimately pleases the Lord.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "Vaivasvata Manu's eldest son of was Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, who was born from Manu's nostrils when he sneezed. Out of the several great kings in Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku's dynasty, M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101 was one. M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101's birth was very interesting. His father, Yuvan\u0101\u015bva, had no sons initially. Therefore, he retired from family life and went to the forest with his hundred wives. In the forest, some sages saw Yuvan\u0101\u015bva and felt compassion for him. Intending to get him a son, the sages performed an Indra-yaj\u00f1a, a sacrifice to please Indra, the king of the devat\u0101s. During the night, Yuvan\u0101\u015bva became very thirsty. Finding no water, he entered the sacrificial arena and drank the sanctified water. That water was meant to be drunk by his wife so that she could give birth to a child. But Yuvan\u0101\u015bva drank it. Later, the brahma\u0146as saw the water pot empty and found that the king had drank that water. Because Yuvan\u0101\u015bva drank the water that was meant for his wife, Yuvan\u0101\u015bva had to give birth to the child. In due course of time, Yuvan\u0101\u015bva gave birth to a powerful son named M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101. The baby cried for his mother's milk, but because he was born to his father, he was bereft of milk. As the br\u0101hma\u0146as were wondering who would feed the child, Indra appeared there. He put his forefinger in the baby's mouth and fed M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101. Being blessed by the brahma\u0146as, Yuvan\u0101\u015bva didn't die, despite giving birth to a baby as a male. After this incident, Yuvan\u0101\u015bva dedicated himself to performing various devotional austerities. Finally, by the Lord's mercy, he attained the spiritual world. Yuvan\u0101\u015bva's son M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101 became a very great emperor. Indra named him Trasaddasyu (giver of fear to criminals) because he would instill fear even in great demoniac rogues like R\u0101vana and others. Residing in the city of Mathura, M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101 was so powerful that he alone ruled the entire world only from one place. M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101 performed many sacrifices for Lord Vi\u015fnu's pleasure and gave profuse charity to the br\u0101hmanas. Mandh\u0101t\u0101 had three sons and fifty daughters. One day, a great sage named Saubhari came to King M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101 and said, Dear King, I would like to get married. Could you please hand me one of your daughters in marriage? Earlier, Saubhari Muni performed austerities alone deep inside River Yamuna's pristine waters. Once, he saw a couple of fish enjoying in the water and desired to get married and enter family life. Thus he came out of River Yamuna and met King Mandh\u0101t\u0101 in Mathur\u0101 city. Seeing the old sage's worn-out condition, M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101 felt, This old br\u0101hma\u0146a is not a suitable husband for my beautiful young daughters. But if I deny his request, he might become upset and even curse me. Thinking thus, Mandh\u0101t\u0101 told Saubhari, Dear br\u0101hmana, my daughters may accept a husband according to their choice. You can see my daughters, and if any one of them chooses to marry you, I have no objection. Saubhari Muni thought, I'm an old and feeble yogi with grey hair and wrinkled skin. Seeing my condition, no woman would like to marry me. And this King almost refused my proposal by giving this reason. But I must somehow marry someone. With my mystic power, I shall reform my body so that even celestial ladies desire to marry me, what to speak of these princesses on the earth. After that, a servant of King M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101 took Saubhari Muni to the lavish quarters of M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101's daughters. On the way, Saubhari Muni transformed into a young handsome man. When he came in front of the fifty princesses, each one of them was attracted to him. So, they all gave up their sisterly relationships and started quarrelling amongst themselves, I will marry him, I will marry him. Finally, they all decided to accept Saubhari Muni as their husband. Due to his expertise in chanting mantras that could create wealth and any facility, Saubhari Muni enjoyed with his wives extravagantly. He had built a well-furnished lavish home surrounded by clean lakes and fragrant gardens with chirping birds, and humming bees. With his yogic power, he enjoyed delicious foods, wonderful garments, and gem-studded ornaments. Even Emperor M\u0101ndh\u0101t\u0101 was surprised and defeated when he saw the opulence of Saubhari Muni. Saubhari thus enjoyed his life for some time and had many children through his fifty wives. But he was not happy at heart. Because hefully forgot his spiritual life and bhakti. One day, he sat in a peaceful place and thought about his deviation from spiritual life by seeing the fish in the river. Then, he regretted,Alas, earlier, I was alone doing austerities inside water. But now, I became the husband of fifty wives and begot a hundred sons from each of them. Now, my family contains five thousand people! I gave up my bhakti towards the Lord and was completely caught in temporary enjoyment. Let me develop detachment and devotion and go to the forest again. Thus, Saubhari Muni retired from family life and resumed his spiritual life. Even his devoted wives followed him. Saubhari Muni dedicatedly worshiped Lord Hari in the forest and finally attained the Lord in the spiritual world. By following their husbands footsteps, even the wives of Saubhari Muni were able to attain Lord Hari's abode.",
        "quotes": "By yogic power, even sages can enjoy great facilities, but the real utility of one's powers is to serve the Lord.",
        "trivia": "DID YOU KNOW? Once, Garuda came to river Yamun\u0101 and ate fish there. Being an eagle, Garuda naturally eats fish. Saubhari Muni, who was performing austerities at Yamun\u0101, desired to protect the fish, and thus cursed Garuda, You will die if you again attempt to eat the fish here. Although powerful Garuda was not obliged to accept this curse, still, he respected the sage's curse and avoided coming to Yamuna again. Thus, Saubhari Muni committed an offense against a great devotee Garuda. Therefore, he distracted from his spiritual life.",

        "lesson": "A LESSON ON DISTRACTION: Anyone can follow the spiritual life, be it a sage or a householder. Great devotee kings like Ambar\u012b\u015fa, Dhruva, Yidhi\u015fthira, Manu, and others worshiped the Lord with great devotion, along with their wives and children. But sometimes, persons like Saubhari might get distracted from spiritual life and become attached to temporary enjoyment. This is due to their offenses to great devotees. Therefore, one must be careful not to offend devotees. However, if one realizes one's mistakes through careful introspection and re-establishes one's determination in spiritual life, one can attain the Lord, just like Saubhari Muni.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "In the dynasty of Mandh\u00e4t\u00e4, there was a king named Bahuka. Despite his heroics, Bahuka's enemies snatched away all his possessions. So, he left his kingdom and entered the forest with his wives. Performing devotional austerities, one day, he left his body. Unable to stay without him, one of his wives wanted to die with him. However, their guru Aurva Muni forbade her because she was pregnant then. But her co-wives became envious of her as she was going to give birth to a child. So they fed her poison to kill the child in her womb. Somehow, the poison did not act, and the child was born with (sa) poison (gara). Therefore he was called Sagara. Sagara later became a great emperor. He performed many sacrifices to please Lord Hari. He had sixty thousand sons. Once, when Sagara performed an A\u015bvamedha sacrifice, Indra became envious of him and stole his sacrificial horse. Sagara's sixty thousand sons searched for the horse, and dug into the earth extensively. Finally, they found the horse near the hermitage of Kapila Muni. Suspecting that Kapila was the thief, they shouted at Him, He is sinful. Kill him! Kill him! As they tried to attack Kapila Muni with their upraised weapons, Kapila opened His eyes. Kapila Muni was an incarnation of Lord Visnu, and the teacher of Sankhya philosophy by which one can attain liberation. By the influence of Indra, the sons of Sagara had lost their intelligence and suspected Lord Kapila. Due to their disrespectful attitude towards a great person, fire emanated from their bodies, and thus, they were at once burnt to ashes. Some people thought that the fire of Kapila's anger burned Sagara's sons. But actually, Kapila never became angry. They all died only because of their offensive attitude toward Lord Kapila. Knowing that his sons were burnt to ashes, King Sagara became very sad. His sacrifice remained incomplete. After some time, Sagara considered how to retrieve his horse. Sagara had a powerful grandson named Am\u015bum\u0101n. Sagara requested Am\u015bum\u0101n to retrieve the sacrificial horse to complete the sacrifice. Am\u0161um\u0101n followed the path dug by his uncles and finally found the horse near a pile of ashes. There, he also saw Lord Kapila. Am\u015bum\u0101n respectfully bowed to Lord Kapila and praised Him with folded hands. Lord Kapila then mercifully explained to him spiritual knowledge and said, Dear Am\u0161um\u0101n, please take this sacrificial horse of your grandfather. Your relatives, lying there as a pile of ashes, can be liberated only by the touch of the waters of River Gang\u0101. Am\u015buman brought the horse back to their kingdom. King Sagara then completed the sacrifice. Following his guru's instructions, Sagara retired from his duties and attained the spiritual world. How would the 60,000 sons lying as piles of ashes be liberated? At that time, River Gang\u0101 didn't flow on the earth. Ganga, after having originated from the lotus toes of Lord V\u00e4mana, meandered across the higher planets only. Someone would have to bring her to the earth. Who would do that, and how? Flip on to find out.",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON SUSPICION: Sometimes, we may doubt the character of an genuine person. Based on what we see with our eyes, we might jump to unnecessary conclusions. Suspecting, accusing, or harming an innocent person without knowing the facts is a great offense. Although wise people don't take such offenses, but such an offense rather harms the offender. External looks may be deceptive, therefore we should think twice before judging someone.",

Dil\u012bpa's son, Bhagiratha, then performed severe austerities to please Ga\u0144g\u0101dev\u012b. Finally, Gang\u0101 appeared before Bhagiratha and said, Dear King, I'm satisfied with your worship. So I shall grant you the boon you wanted. Bhagiratha said, O, worshipable Goddess, my only desire is to deliver my ancestors. They are lying near Lord Kapila's hermitage as a pile of ashes. They'll regain their forms only when your waters touch them. Mother Ganga said, Dear Bhagiratha, I can come to the earth from the upper planets, but when I fall from the sky, my waters will be so forceful that I could pierce the Earth's surface and go to the lower planets. Who will sustain my force? Bhagiratha replied, Dear mother, Lord \u015aiva is very powerful. He can sustain your forceful waves on his head. I will request him to help me. Ganga Devi then expressed her second concern, Dear Bhagiratha, on the earth, people will bathe in my waters to be purified of their sinful reactions. How then shall I be freed from the sins that I accumulate? Bhagiratha replied, Dear mother, the devotees of Lord Hari are pure in their character, and can purify the entire world. They carry Lord Hari within their hearts. Because Hari can destroy sin, when His devotees take a bath in your waters, they can remove all the sins you have accumulated because of the bathing of sinful people. Gang\u0101 Devi was pleased with Bhagiratha's answers and finally agreed to descend from the upper planets to the planet of Earth. Bhagiratha then performed severe austerities to satisfy Lord \u015aiva. Lord \u015aiva has another name called, \u0100\u015buto\u0219a, which refers to the one who is pleased very quickly. Eventually, Lord \u015aiva became pleased and accepted Bhagiratha's request. After that, the mighty river Gang\u0101 began to descend from the heavens unto the earth. Lord Siva sustained the water on his head. Thus Gang\u0101 flowed through the locks of Lord \u015aiva's hair. Bhagiratha began to drive on a swift chariot, and river Gang\u0101 followed him. She purified many places until she reached the ashes of the sons of Sagara. Then, simply by being sprinkled with the water of Ganga, the sixty thousand sons of Sagara were elevated to the heavenly planets. Although offending Lord Kapila destroyed Sagara's sons, they were still purified by the touch of mother Gang\u0101. Who are the descendants of Bhagiratha?

Those who are determined are fully focussed on their goals without any distractions. But those who are not determined become diverted towards multiple things. When we are determined, we automatically get support from others and higher powers. Our sincere desire and determined efforts coupled with support from great souls guarantees success. Determined people easily attain success because they accept whatever is favorable to attain their goals and reject whatever is unfavorable. But those who lack such determination cannot easily achieve their goals.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "In the dynasty of Bhagiratha, there was a great King named Saud\u0101sa. He had a beautiful queen named Damayanti. Once, Saud\u0101sa went to the forest to hunt. In the forest, he saw a R\u0101k\u1e63asa, a fierce demon accustomed to troubling innocent people. So Saud\u0101sa fought with the R\u0101k\u1e63asa and killed him. The Raksasa had a brother who wanted to take revenge on Saud\u0101sa. Later, when Saud\u0101sa returned to his kingdom, the Raksasa's brother came to king's palace and entered his kitchen in the disguise of a cook. One day, Saud\u0101sa invited his guru Vasistha for dinner. The Raksasa cook then intentionally served sage Vasistha human flesh. Seeing that, Vasistha Muni became offended. He angrily spoke to Saud\u0101sa, O King, you have invited me to take meals at your home, and you are feeding me human flesh! I am a br\u0101hmana! Do you think I'm a Raksasa who eats human flesh? For this grave offense of yours, I curse you to become a man-eating Raksasa. Saud\u0101sa never had the intention to insult Vasistha. The human flesh was served by the R\u0101k\u1e63asa and not by Saud\u0101sa. But considering the facts and not even inquiring, Vasistha impulsively cursed Saud\u0101sa. Saud\u0101sa became angry at Vasistha Muni's curse. Intending to curse Vasistha in return, he took water in his hands and chanted the \u015bapa-mantra, the hymns of the curse. Then his wife Damayanti immediately stopped him saying, It's not proper to curse a br\u0101hma\u0146a and guru. Hearing his wife's advice, Saud\u0101sa restrained himself from cursing Vasistha. He threw the water on his own feet because if he had thrown that water anywhere else, it would harm the living beings in that direction. The curse-water that Saud\u0101sa threw on his feet created a black spot on his feet. Therefore, Saud\u0101sa was also called Kalm\u0101\u015fap\u0101da. Realizing his mistake, Vasistha Muni made the curse on Saud\u0101sa last only for twelve years. Also, as an atonement for cursing the innocent King, he undertook severe austerities for twelve years.Because of Vasistha's curse, Saud\u0101sa acquired the nature of a man-eating Raksasa and wandered in the forest. One day, he saw a br\u0101hma\u1e47a couple in the forest, and wanted to eat the flesh of the brahma\u0146a. Then the wife of the brahma\u0146a begged Saud\u0101sa, O King, you are the endant of the disyaku dynasty. You are not a R\u0101k\u1e63asa. Please do not act cruelly. Please return my husband. He's a learned brahma\u0146a performing devotional austerities for Lord Hari's pleasure. A saintly king must protect br\u0101hma\u0146as and not act harm them. In this way, the wife of the brahma\u0146a's wife piteously requested Saud\u0101sa not to kill her husband. But because of the power of Vasistha's curse, Saud\u0101sa exhibited the nature of a R\u0101k\u1e63asa and ate the brahma\u0146a. Overwhelmed with grief, the chaste br\u0101hma\u1e47\u012b cursed Saud\u0101sa, O fool, O sinful man, you have separated me from my husband. Because you have eaten him up, I will not have a child now. I curse you that you will die whenever you go near your wife, and you cannot have a child. Then the brahma\u0146a's wife set fire to her husband's bones, and out of intense separation from him, she also fell into the fire herself. She thus attained the same destination as her husband. After living like a R\u0101k\u1e63asa for twelve years, Saud\u0101sa was released from Vasistha's curse. Because of the curse of the brahmana's wife, Saud\u0101sa could not get a child. Later, by the power of Vasistha, Saud\u0101sa's wife Damayanti begot a child after seven years. There were celebrations in all corners of the kingdom when the king begot a child.",
        "quotes": "Even sages sometimes become angry and impulsive and unnecessarily curse innocent people.",
        "lesson": "A LESSON ON ANGER: Since time immemorial, uncontrolled anger has only led to unpleasant outcomes and never to noble results. Even great personalities are victimized by anger. For example, Vasistha, although a sage, impulsively cursed his innocent disciple Saud\u0101sa although, in truth, it was the R\u0101k\u1e63asa, not Saud\u0101sa, who had served Vasistha human flesh. As a result, the anger in Saud\u0101sa also erupted. He, too was about to counter-curse his guru! But he abstained from doing so due to the timely intervention of his wife, Damayanti.",

        "story": "In the dynasty of Saud\u0101sa, there was an unconquerable king named Khatv\u0101nga. Once, the devat\u0101s from the heavens requested Khatv\u0101nga for his help in a fight with the asuras. Khatv\u0101nga agreed, and just with little effort, he easily defeated all the fierce asuras. The devat\u0101s became very happy and told him, Dear King, we are very pleased with your selfless service. We wish to offer you a boon. Please ask for a boon. Khatv\u0101nga replied, Dear devat\u0101s, can you please tell me how much more time I will live? The devat\u0101s replied, Dear Khatv\u0101nga, you only have one muh\u016brt\u0101 (48 minutes) more to live. Hearing this, Khatvanga immediately went to his palace. He wanted to utilize whatever little time he had to think of the Lord Vasudeva without any distractions. Kha\u1e6dv\u0101nga prayed, Dear Lord, no one and nothing is more dear to me than Your beloved devotees. My kingdom, land, wife, children, and wealth are not attractive to me. I haven't found anything more satisfying than devotion unto You. I am not interested in any material boons. I could have asked anything from the devat\u0101s, but when they offered me a boon, I did not wish to take anything from them. I only want to take Your shelter with full devotion. Thus, firmly deciding, Khatv\u0101nga gave up his body and attained Lord Vasudeva in the spiritual world. In the dynasty of Khatvanga, there were several great kings, of whom Da\u015baratha was one. Da\u015baratha had four sons who were the expansions of Lord Visnu. The eldes of them was Lord Ramacandra, whose heart-wrenching activities are a feast for the ears to hear and touch the devotees' hearts. Read His exciting pastimes in the next chapter.",

        "title": "R\u0101ma, The Jewel of the Sun Dynasty",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "Once, when demoniac people overburdened the earth, all the devat\u0101s approached Lord Visnu. They offered prayers for His appearance on the earth. Pleased by their devotion and concerned about their condition, Lord Visnu appeared as R\u0101macandra in the Sun dynasty, as the son of King Da\u015baratha. Accompanied by His divine brothers, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna, Lord Rama resided in Ayodhya. Once, sage Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra came to Ayodhya and requested Da\u015baratha, I am performing a sacrifice in the forest, and some mischievous asuras named Marica and Sub\u0101hu are disturbing it. Please send R\u0101ma to protect my sacrifice. Although Da\u015baratha hesitated in the beginning, he finally sent R\u0101ma and Laksma\u0146a with Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. Lord Rama effortlessly slashed and defeated the demons who disturbed Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra's sacrifice. After that, Lord Rama went to Mithila along with Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. Janaka, the King of Mithila, had set the condition that he would give his daughter S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b in marriage only to that prince who could lift Lord \u015aiva's humongous bow. This bow was so heavy that even 300 powerful men would struggle to lift it together. Young Rama effortlessly lifted the bow, tried to string it, and broke it into two pieces, just as a baby elephant would break apart sugarcane. King Janaka became extremely joyful and conducted the marriage of S\u012bta and Rama. S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b was an embodiment of beauty and good character. She was an expansion of Lak\u1e63m\u012bdevi. Lord Rama happily stayed in Ayodhy\u0101 along with S\u012bt\u0101devi. Considering his advancing age, one day, Da\u015baratha decided to retire after enthroning Lord Rama as the King. At that time, his wife Kaikeyi, influenced by her evil maidservant Manthar\u0101, asked King Da\u015baratha for a boon. She said, Dear King please fulfill my wish. I want you to enthrone my son, Bharata as the King of Ayodhy\u0101, and send Lord Rama on exile to the forest for fourteen years. Although Da\u015baratha was not happy to do this, he was obliged due to his promise to Kaikey\u012b in the past. To fulfill the obligation of King Da\u015baratha, Lord R\u0101ma being an ideal son, at once went to the forest along with S\u012bt\u0101 and Laksmana. He wasn't disappointed, even to the least. All the residents of Ayodhy\u0101 were immersed in an ocean of tears as R\u0101ma was leaving. While Lord Ramacandra lived with Laksmana and Sit\u00e4 in the forest, one day, a woman approached Him with a proposal. She was S\u00fcrpanakh\u0101, the sister of the King of the demons, R\u0101vana. Attracted by Rama's beauty, she wished to marry Him, but R\u0101ma rejected her proposal. She then approached Laksma\u0146a, who also rejected her. Infuriated, S\u00fcrpanakh\u0101 attacked S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b and tried to devour her. Seeing this, Laksmana cut her nose and ears and sent her away. To avenge this insult, S\u00fcrpanakh\u0101 brought fourteen thousand R\u00e4k\u015fasa soldiers headed by Khara and D\u016bsana, to destroy R\u0101ma and Laksma\u0146a. R\u0101ma singlehandedly killed all of them within no time. \u015a\u016brpa\u0146akh\u0101 then went to her brother R\u0101vana and described S\u012bt\u0101devi's extraordinary beauty. Hearing this, R\u0101vana desired to kidnap and marry S\u012bt\u0101devi. To lure R\u0101ma away from Sita, R\u0101vana had sent a demon named M\u0101r\u012bca in the disguise of a beautiful golden deer. S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b saw the deer and pleaded with R\u0101ma to bring that deer to her. R\u0101ma agreed and asked Laksmana to protect S\u012bt\u0101 while He pursued the deer. Lord Rama followed the mystical golden deer for some time and finally shot an arrow. Pierced by the arrow, the deer, demon M\u0101r\u012bca, shouted for protection while imitating R\u0101ma's voice. Hearing that, S\u012bt\u0101 became anxious for Lord Rama's safety and sent Laksma\u0146a to help R\u0101ma. While both Rama and Laksmana were thus away, R\u0101vana appeared there in the disguise of a saintly br\u0101hma\u0146a. Standing before S\u012bt\u0101's cottage, he begged for some food. S\u012bt\u0101 innocently came out to offer alms to the so-called saint at her doorstep. R\u0101va\u0146a then showed his true form and kidnapped Sit\u00e4. As R\u0101vana was taking S\u012bt\u0101 on his airplane, she piteously cried out for help. Then a vulture named Ja\u021b\u0101yu came and fought with R\u0101vana in the sky. After a brief yet intense fight, R\u0101vana killed Jat\u0101yu, who then fell to the ground. Meanwhile, R\u0101ma and Laksma\u0146a came back to their home, only to find S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b missing. Searching for her everywhere, they finally saw Ja\u0163\u0101yu lying dead. Pleased with the vulture's devotion, R\u0101ma performed Ja\u021b\u0101yu's last rites just like a son performs the father's last rights. Continuing Their search for S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, Rama met the monkey warriors Sugr\u012bva and Hanuman. R\u0101ma made friendship with Sugr\u012bva and helped him regain his kingdom by killing his brother V\u00e4li. After that, Sugr\u012bva sent many of his monkey soldiers in different directions to search for mother S\u012bt\u0101. Finally, mighty Hanuman found S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b in R\u0101vana's kingdom La\u0144k\u0101 and informed Lord Rama about her. Eager to rescue S\u012bt\u0101 at once, R\u0101ma decided to go to Lanka. Accompanied by Laksmana, Hanuman, Sugr\u012bva, and innumerable monkey soldiers, He soon reached the shores of the vast Lank\u0101 ocean. R\u0101ma wanted the help of the ocean god, Samudra, to cross the ocean. He fasted for three days waiting for Samudra's help, but the ocean god didn't respond. Lord Rama then became furious. Just by His mere angry glance, all the aquatics in the ocean became frightened. Seeing Lord Rama's rage, the ocean god immediately came and fell at R\u0101ma's feet and prayed, O Lord, being so ignorant, I didn't understand that You are the Supreme Lord. You may cross the ocean easily, but I have one request for You. Please construct a bridge on my waters only so future generations can glorify You for this uncommon deed. Lord Ramacandra agreed and started constructing a stone bridge over the ocean with the help of His innumerable monkey soldiers. The monkeys enthusiastically threw the rocks into the ocean, and by the Lord's divine power and presence, the stones floated, and a huge bridge was made quickly, and everyone reached Laik\u0101. A fierce battle ensued between Lord Rama's monkey army and R\u0101vana's R\u0101k\u1e63asa army. The Raksasas held invincible weapons like swords, lances, bows and arrows. But the monkeys only had boulders, and trees that they hurled against the Raksasas. Still, the monkeys easily killed the Raksasas only because they had the blessings of mother S\u012bt\u0101. Finally, R\u0101va\u0146a appeared on the scene to fight Rama. An intense and intriguing war took place between both powerful personalities. Finally, Lord Rama shot a fierce arrow that pierced R\u0101vana, who helplessly fell from his airplane while vomiting blood from his ten mouths. Lord Rama finally met S\u012bt\u0101 in the A\u015boka garden. She was very emaciated in separation from R\u0101ma. Seeing her condition, R\u0101ma became emotional and compassionate. Seeing R\u0101ma, S\u012bt\u0101's face blossomed like a lotus in joy. After the divine reunion of S\u012bt\u0101 and R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma enthroned Vibh\u012b\u1e63ana as the King of Lank\u0101. He then returned to Ayodhy\u0101 along with S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, Laksmana, Hanuman, and Sugr\u012bva in an airplane. His period of living in the forest had ended by that time. At Ayodhy\u0101, R\u0101ma was greeted by His mothers, brothers and other residents in great joy. Sage Vasistha enthroned Rama as the King of Ayodhy\u0101. All the citizens of Ayodhy\u0101 lived happily under the loving protection of Lord Ramacandra. By attentively hearing the story of Lord Rama, one will be relieved from the disease of envy.",

        "story": "In the sun dynasty, there was another great king named Nimi. Once, he wanted to perform a sacrifice and requested Vasistha Muni to be the chief priest. Vasistha then told him, Dear Nimi, I have already accepted the duty of a chief priest in another sacrifice conducted by Indra. Please wait till I perform that sacrifice and come back. Nimi became silent as Vasistha left. Nimi then thought to himself, Life is temporary. Why should I delay my sacrifice and waste time? Moreover, there are many other priests. Let me ask them to conduct the sacrifice. Thinking thus, Nimi performed the sacrifice with other priests without waiting for Vasistha. After Vasistha completed Indra's sacrifice and returned, he found that Nimi had already completed the sacrifice. So, he became outraged and cursed Nimi, Being so arrogant, you considered yourself very learned and didn't follow my orders. So, may your body fall. King Nimi replied, O sage, you're so greedy for the donations from the heavenly king Indra. You have lost your intelligence just for some little wealth. May your body also fall. Due to Vasistha's curse, Nimi gave up his body. However, the brahma\u0146as preserved it using fragrant substances. After the successful completion of the sacrifice, the br\u0101hma\u0146as requested the devat\u0101s, O devat\u0101s, if you are pleased by our sacrifice, kindly bring Nimi back to life. The devat\u0101s immediately agreed. But Nimi said, Respectable devat\u0101s, Please don't imprison me in a material body again. Staying in a body is just like staying within a prison cell. I'd rather stay in my spiritual body and meditate on the Lord Hari's form and pastimes. The devat\u0101s replied, As Nimi wishes, may he not have a material body. Let him live in a spiritual body as a personal associate of Lord Visnu We bless him with a boon to become visible or invisible to common people whenever he wishes. In this way, Nimi continued to stay in a spiritual body and always meditated on Lord Visnu. The Lord can decide whenever He wants to reveal Himself to us and whenever He doesn't want to. This same privilege of being seen or unseen, according to one's wish, was also bestowed upon Nimi. Thus, Nimi lived in his original spiritual body as an associate of Lord Visnu. According to Nimi's curse, Vasistha also gave up his body and later, again, was born through the heavenly damsel Urva\u015b\u012b. These were the stories of the great kings of the sun dynasty. Read on to know the exciting stories of the kings in the moon dynasty.",

        "title": "The Story of Satyavati & Ac\u012bka",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "King Pur\u016brav\u0101 was the grandson of Soma, the moon god. He was very handsome and powerful. He married the heavenly damsel named Urva\u015b\u012b. At one point in time, Urva\u015b\u012b left Pur\u016brav\u0101 and went back to heaven. Then Pur\u016brav\u0101 performed a sacrifice and attained Urva\u015b\u012b in the Gandharvaloka. After spending a long time with Urva\u015bi, he realized he was getting lost in temporary enjoyment. He then sincerely worshiped Lord Vi\u015fnu and ultimately attained the Lord. In the dynasty of Pur\u00fcrava, there was a king named Gadhi. He had a beautiful daughter named Satyavati. Once, sage Rcika approached King Gadhi and said, I would like to marry your daughter Satyavati. Gadhi saw the sage and felt he was an unfit husband for his young daughter. So, G\u0101dhi asked Rc\u012bka for an uncommon dowry, Dear sage, I shall get my daughter married to you, but on one condition. You should bring one thousand shining white horses, each having one black ear, either left or right. Rc\u012bka could understand G\u0101dhi's mind. So, being a powerful mystic, he went to Varunadeva, the master of oceans, and brought the thousand horses that Gadhi wanted. King G\u0101dhi was surprised, and then happily conducted the marriage of sage Rc\u012bka and his daughter Satyavati. After some time, Satyavati wanted a son. Her mother desired a son too. So, sage Rc\u012bka conducted a sacrifice so that they both could give birth to glorious sons. In the sacrifice, Rc\u012bka prepared two oblations of rice, one for his wife with a br\u0101hma\u0146a mantra and another for his mother-in-law with a ksatriya mantra. Because sage Satyavati was living in a hermitage as the wife of a br\u0101hma\u0146a sage, it would be more appropriate for her to become the mother of a brahminical son. And because Satyavati's mother was the wife of king Gadhi, she was more fit to give birth to a ksatriya son who could fight and rule. After preparing the two oblations, sage Rc\u012bka went out to bathe. Meanwhile, Satyavati's mother approached Satyavati and said, My dear daughter, can you please give your oblation to me and accept mine? Because your husband loves you, he must have prepared a special oblation for you. I wish to have it. Satyavati loved her mother and happily exchanged oblations with her mother. After some time, sage Rc\u012bka returned. He understood what had happened in his absence. He then spoke to his wife Satyavati, Because you have exchanged the oblations with your mother, your son will be a fierce k\u1e63atriya who punishes everyone. And your mother's son will be a scholarly br\u0101hma\u0146a. Satyavati was surprised, and felt guilty that she could not understand her wise husband's impartial nature. She then begged forgiveness from Rc\u012bka and requested him, Please let my son not become a k\u1e63atriya for my mistake. I'm a br\u0101hma\u1e47a's wife. It would be more appropriate to give birth to a son with brahminical qualities like tolerance, forgiveness, scholarship, and self-control. Rc\u012bka kindly replied, It is impossible to change the effects of what you have done. But seeing your repentance, I can postpone the effects of the oblations you drank. I bless that your son will be a br\u0101hmana, but your grandson will become a courageous ksatriya. After some time, Satyavati's mother gave birth to a son named Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. Although Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was born as a k\u1e63atriya, later he became a br\u0101hma\u0146a sage. Satyavati gave birth to a son named Jamadagni, a great br\u0101hma\u0146a. Later, Jamadagni married Re\u0146uk\u0101 and gave birth to many sons, of whom the youngest was Para\u015bur\u0101ma. Born with k\u1e63atriya qualities, Para\u015bur\u0101ma was an incarnation of Lord Krsna. He destroyed the unrighteous and proud k\u1e63atriyas twenty-one times and thus reduced the earth's burden.

        "story": "K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna was the powerful king of the Haihaya dynasty. He lived in M\u0101hi\u015fmat\u012b, his mighty capital, with his ten thousand sons. He worshiped Lord Dattatreya by performing severe austerities and received the rare boon of possessing a thousand arms. Undefeatable and endowed with astonishing mystic powers, the king roamed the universe without any opposition. Once, proud K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna went to river Narmad\u0101. Desiting to enjoy water sports in the river, he stopped the flow of Narmada with his thousand arms. Because of this, the river flowed in the opposite direction and inundated the camp of the King of demons, R\u0101vana. At that time, R\u0101va\u0146a was worshipping the devat\u0101s near the city of M\u0101hi\u015fmat\u012b, the capital of K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna. The ten-headed demon R\u0101vana became furious and went to fight with K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna. But K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna easily defeated and arrested R\u0101vana as if he were a small monkey. Later, he released R\u0101vana in a neglectful manner to prove his superiority. Once, K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna went to the forest to hunt. Wandering in the forest, he came to the hermitage of sage Jamadagni. Jamadagni was performing his meditation in that forest. Seeing the king coming to his home, the sage respectfully welcomed him and his associates. Whatever his guests needed, Jamadagni could provide very easily. K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna was surprised at Jamadagni's hospitality. He thought, How does this simple sage living in a forest provide my soldiers and me with so many lavish Macilities pusomething seems to be suspicious. K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna found out that sage Jamadagni had K\u00e4madhenu, a mystical cow that could supply anything that the sage wanted. K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna felt envious of Jamadagni. He couldn't tolerate that a simple sage could be more powerful and opulent than himself. K\u00e4rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna then rudely demanded Jamadagni, You are a mere sage in the forest. This exquisite cow is of no use to you. I want your K\u00e4madhenu cow! Jamadagni politely replied, You cannot ask for a br\u0101hmana's property. My K\u0101madhenu cow provides all the ingredients for my regular sacrifices and worship. Without this cow, I won't be able to conduct my devotional ceremonies. Despite the sage's humble request, arrogant K\u00e4rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna ordered his soldiers, Bring that cow along with her calf to my capital M\u0101hismati. Following the order, the soldiers of K\u00e4rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna forcefully dragged K\u0101madhenu and her calf. Jamadagni helplessly watched his cow being taken away. Hearing about this nefarious activity of the King, Jamadagni's son, Para\u015bur\u0101ma became furious like a trampled snake. He took up his weapons and chased K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna just as a lion chases an elephant. Seeing raging Para\u015bur\u0101ma in a black deerskin with matted locks of hair that shone like the sun, K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna became fearful. He then sent his seventeen ak\u015fauhin\u012bs of armies equipped with elephants, swords, arrows, and other weapons to fight against Para\u015bur\u0101ma. As soon as these soldiers came in front of Him, the Lord sliced off their legs, arms, and shoulders with his axe at the speed of the mind and wind. He killed the soldiers, their drivers, elephants, and horses effortlessly. The battlefield became drenched with blood as Para\u015bur\u0101ma singlehandedly killed all the warriors. Then, K\u00e4rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna rushed onto the battlefield personally. He fixed arrows on five hundred bows with his thousand arms to kill Para\u015bur\u0101ma. However, heroic Para\u015bur\u0101ma released enough arrows with only one bow that cut down to pieces all the weapons of K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna. K\u00e4rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna then uprooted many trees and mountain peaks and threw them towards the Lord. However, Para\u015bur\u0101ma slashed down all those rocks simply with his powerful axe. Finally, Para\u015bur\u0101ma cut off all the thousand hands and the head of K\u00e4rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna. He then gloriously brought back the K\u0101madhenu cow with her calf and gave her to Jamadagni. Jamadagni didn't appreciate his son's act. So, he spoke to Para\u015bur\u0101ma, Dear son, you are a great hero, but you have unnecessarily killed the King. A King is supposed to be the embodiment of all the devat\u0101s. He is the protector of all the citizens. He should not be killed this way, even if he has committed an offense. My dear son, we br\u0101hma\u0146as have become worshipable by people because of our quality of forgiveness. Lord Hari is pleased by those who are forgiving. As br\u0101hma\u0146as, we are supposed to forgive and not punish. Ksatriyas are recognized by their heroism, but br\u0101hma\u0146as are recognized by their forgiveness. To atone for this sinful act of killing the king, I suggest you visit different holy places for a year. Para\u015bur\u0101ma didn't argue with his father. He took the advice, travelled to different holy places for one full year, and then returned to his father's house. The ten thousand sons of K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna became very sad after their father's death. To seek revenge, they all came to Jamadagni's hermitage in the absence of Para\u015bur\u0101ma and his brothers. They saw Jamadagni sitting by the side of the sacrificial fire and meditating upon Lord Visnu. Then, those most sinful and cruel people cut off Jamadagni's head mercilessly. Although the sage's wife, Renuk\u0101, cried piteously, they didn't care to show a ray of compassion. Renuka then called out loudly in pain, O Para\u015bur\u0101ma, my dear son! Where are you? Hearing her loud cries, Para\u015bur\u0101ma, who was far away, immediately rushed towards her. When he hastily came to the hermitage, he saw his father's dead body. He became furious with mixed feelings of sorrow. He then entrusted his father's dead body to his brothers and took up his axe. Deciding to put an end to all the proud and cruel k\u1e63atriyas, he went to the city of M\u0101hi\u015fmati. Para\u015bur\u0101ma effortlessly killed the ten thousand sons of K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna and made a mountain of their heads in the middle of the city of M\u0101hismati. A river of blood flowed there, causing fear in all those who disrespected br\u0101hma\u0146as. After that, Para\u015bur\u0101ma wanted to make the entire earth devoid of polluted k\u1e63atriyas who were disrespectful to br\u0101hma\u0146as. Twenty-one times consecutively, he had killed several k\u1e63atriyas and created nine lakes with their blood at a place called Samanta-pa\u00f1caka. Para\u015burama then joined his father's head to his dead body, placed it upon ku\u015ba grass, and worshiped Lord Krsna with a sacrifice. Thus he brought his father back to life. Jamadagni, who regained his life, became one of the seven great sages in the group of seven stars. Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma still lives in the Mahendra mountains. In this way, the Supreme Lord descended as Para\u015bur\u0101ma avatar in the Bhrgu dynasty and released the universe from the burden of undesirable kings by killing them many times.",

        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "Vrsaparva was the King of asuras. He had a beautiful young daughter named Sarmisth\u0101. She was innocent but angry by nature. Vrsaparva's guru was Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya, who had a lovely daughter named Devayani. Devay\u0101n\u012b and \u015aarmisth\u0101 were good friends. Once, Devay\u0101n\u012b, \u015aarmisth\u0101, and other girls went to a lake to bathe. They left their clothing on the bank, and entered the lake to enjoy its cool waters. They happily swam and bathed for some time. Suddenly, Lord \u015aiva and P\u0101rvat\u012b came there on a bull carrier. Seeing \u015aiva and P\u0101rvat\u012b passing by, the girls felt shy. They quickly got out of the water and started wearing their dresses hastily. \u015aarmisth\u0101 unknowingly wore Devay\u0101n\u012b's dress. This made Devay\u0101n\u012b angry. Devay\u0101n\u012b was a br\u0101hmana girl and \u015aarmisth\u0101 was a k\u1e63atriya girl. So, Devay\u0101n\u012b rebuked \u015aarmisth\u0101, \u015aarmisth\u0101, why did you wear my dress? I come from a br\u0101hma\u0146a family, and I'm superior to you. You are like my maidservant. You have put on my dress just like a dog snatches the ghee meant for a sacrifice. You have no etiquette. The brahmanas created this universe by their austerities. They are the face of Lord Visnu, and they always keep the Lord within their hearts. They are natural teachers of the entire world and are worshippable even by the devat\u0101s. Among the br\u0101hma\u0146as, we are even more respectable because we come from the Bhrgu dynasty. Your father is our disciple. Yet, you dare to put on my dress. Hearing Devay\u0101n\u012b's harsh words, \u015aarmisth\u0101 became angry and said, You beggar! You boast about yourself even without understanding your position. Don't you br\u0101hma\u0146as wait at our house for your livelihood like crows? My father gives charity to your father, and thus you people survive. Without we ksatriyas, you br\u0101hma\u0146as cannot even live. Thus, Sarmisth\u0101 ragingly scolded Devay\u0101n\u012b. Snatching away her garments, she pushed Devay\u0101n\u012b into a well. \u015aarmisth\u0101 just went home. Meanwhile, a King named Yayati in the moon dynasty happened to pass by that well. He was on a hunting excursion. He came to that well to drink water and saw Devay\u0101n\u012b inside the well. He immediately gave his upper cloth, kindly caught her hand, and lifted her out of the well. Devay\u0101n\u012b became very grateful to Yay\u0101ti and said, O King, thank you for saving me. By holding my hand, you have accepted me as your married wife. Our relationship has been arranged by destiny. Although I come from a brahmana family and you are a ksatriya, I would like to marry you. Once, I was cursed by Kaca, the son of B\u1e5bhaspati, that I would not get a br\u0101hma\u0146a husband. Kaca was the son of Brhaspati. Once, Kaca came to Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya to learn mrta-sa\u00f1j\u012bvan\u012b, the art of reviving a person who has died untimely. Seeing Kaca's extraordinary qualities, Devay\u0101n\u012b wanted Kaca as her husband. So she went to him and expressed her wish. But Kaca refused to say, You are the daughter of my guru. Therefore, I cannot marry you. Devay\u0101n\u012b became angry and cursed him, Your knowledge would become useless. Kaca also became angry and cursed her, You will never get a br\u0101hma\u0146a husband. Remembering this incident, Devay\u0101n\u012b requested Yay\u0101ti to marry her. Accepting Devay\u0101n\u012b's request, Yay\u0101ti returned to his palace. Devay\u0101n\u012b went back to her home. Crying, she told her father \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya how she had been thrown into the well by \u015aarmisth\u00e4 and was saved by Yay\u0101ti. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya became aggrieved. He took her daughter and met his disciple Vrsaparv\u00e4 to settle the grievance. Meanwhile, Vr\u015faparv\u00e4 understood that Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya was coming to him in anger. So, he fell at Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya's feet, trying to pacify him. \u0160ukr\u0101c\u0101rya spoke to Vrsaparv\u0101, O King, your daughter has insulted my daughter. Now, you must please my daughter and fulfill whatever she asks from you. Vrsaparv\u00e4 immediately agreed. Then Devayani said, Whenever I marry, \u015aarmisth\u0101 must come with me as my maidservant along with her friends. Vrsaparv\u0101 was surprised to hear this, but he was also afraid of Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya's curse. So, he allowed his daughter Sarmisth\u0101 to become a maidservant of Devay\u0101ni. \u015aarmisth\u0101 now had to serve Devay\u0101n\u012b like a slave. Later, Devay\u0101n\u012b married Yay\u0101ti and took \u015aarmisth\u0101 as a maidservant. Eventually, Devay\u0101n\u012b gave birth to two sons. Yay\u0101ti also accepted \u0160armisth\u0101 as his wife, and through her, he begot three sons. Devay\u0101n\u012b came to know that her husband, Yay\u0101ti, also had sons through Sarmisth\u0101. She then angrily complained to her father. \u0160ukr\u0101c\u0101rya became angry and cursed Yay\u0101ti, You fool, I curse you to become disfigured by old age and invalidity. Because of Sukr\u0101c\u0101rya's curse, Yay\u0101ti became old. Seeing him. \u0160ukr\u0101c\u0101rya calmed down and said, You may exchange your old age with someone who agrees to give you his youth. Yay\u0101ti then asked his eldest son Yadu, My dear son, can you take my old age and give me your youth? Yadu didn't agree, because he knew that in his dynasty, the Supreme Lord Krsna would be taking birth in the future. So, he did not want to give his youth to his father, thus delaying Krsna's appearance. Then, Yay\u0101ti asked his other sons, but they all refused to accept his old age. Finally, Yayati asked his last son P\u016bru. P\u016bru replied, My dear father, who can repay a father's debt? By your mercy, I got this human life. If giving my youth to you satisfies you, I will happily do that. In this way, P\u016bru accepted Yay\u00e4t\u00ed's old age, and Yay\u0101ti took P\u016bru's youth and enjoyed this world for a long time. Despite enjoying the kingdom for a thousand years, Yay\u0101ti was not satisfied at his heart. He thus became detached from all his wealth. One day, he called his wife Devay\u0101n\u012b and shared his realization, This world is a temporary place filled with miseries. Whatever enjoyment we have here is also temporary. Hence, we must always worship Lord Hari fully and then aim to reach His eternal abode. Deciding thus, Yay\u0101ti returned his youth to his son P\u016bru and accepted his old age. He divided his kingdom amongst his sons and retired. He sincerely worshiped Lord Vasudeva with devotion. By the Lord's mercy, he entered the spiritual world. Devay\u0101n\u012b also fixed her mind on Lord Krsna and attained liberation. Thus, both husband and wife made their lives successful by surrendering them to the Lord.",

Similarly, allowing oneself to enjoy this world doesn't decrease one's desires but increases them.

The Bh\u0101gavatam presents the stories of great people like Pur\u016brava, Yay\u0101ti and Indra, who desired material joys and got frustrated. Ultimately, they took shelter of the Lord.

        "story": "In the glorious dynasty of King P\u016bru, there was a powerful King named Du\u015fmanta. One day, Du\u015fmanta went to the forest to hunt. Wandering in the forest, he became tired and came to the hermitage of sage Kanva. There he saw a beautiful woman named \u015aakuntal\u0101. Du\u015fmanta asked her, Whose daughter are you? Why are you living in this forest alone? It appears that you are a princess, a ksatriya's daughter. I am Dusmanta, from the P\u016bru Dynasty. \u015aakuntal\u0101 replied, O King, I am the daughter of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. My mother is Menak\u0101, a damsel from heaven. I personally never saw or knew my parents. Now, I am growing under the protection of Kanva Muni. I welcome you to our humble hermitage. Please tell me how I can serve you. Would you like to eat some wild rice? You can stay here as long as you want. Impressed with the hospitality and good culture of \u015aakuntal\u0101, Dusmanta said, O \u015aakuntal\u0101, your words, and reception are quite worthy of your great family. The daughters of a king generally select their husbands. If you wish so, you can choose me as your husband. Hearing Dusmanta's proposal, \u015aakuntal\u0101 kept silent. Her silence indicated her agreement. Du\u015fmanta then married her right in the forest by chanting o\u1e41k\u0101ra by the Gandharva style of marriage. After that, Du\u015fmanta stayed at the hermitage of \u015aakuntala for some time and returned to his palace. In due course of time, \u015aakuntal\u0101 gave birth to a beautiful son named Bharata. Kanva Muni performed the prescribed rituals for the child. The boy became so powerful that he would capture a lion and play with it. This boy was an incarnation of Lord Vi\u015fnu. After some time, when the boy was a little grown-up, Sakuntal\u0101 and her son went to the Kingdom of Du\u015fmanta. Seeing Sakuntal\u0101 and the child, Du\u015fmanta refused to accept them initially. Then an unembodied voice spoke from the sky, O Du\u015fmanta, \u015aakuntal\u0101 is your wife, and that boy is your son. His name is Bharata. You should accept your wife and son without any hesitation. Dusmanta knew that \u015aakuntala and the boys were his wife and son, but because they came from outside and were unknown to the citizens, he initially didn't accept them. But \u015aakuntala was so chaste that an omen declared the truth so everyone could know her chastity. So then Dusmanta gladly accepted them. After Du\u015fmanta passed away, his son Bharata was enthroned as the world's emperor. An incarnation of Lord Visnu, Bharata had a mark of Krsna's cakra on his right palm. In addition, he had a mark of lotus whorl on the soles of his feet. He performed fifty-five a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1as on the bank of the river Ganges and seventy-eight a\u015bvamedha yaj\u00f1as on the bank of river Yamuna. His opulence and power surpassed even the greatest of devat\u0101s. No one could imitate the Lord's extraordinary wonderful activities in the past, nor will anyone be able to do so in the future.",

        "title": "Rantideva's Selfless Charity",
        "scripture": "Bhagavata Purana - Canto 9",
        "story": "In the moon dynasty, there once lived a righteous king named Rantideva. He was an embodiment of kindness. He was known for his great acts of charity. He would even take up difficulties upon himself to help others. Unsurprisingly, his name and fame spread to every corner of the earth and in heaven. Rantideva was never greedy to earn a lot of wealth. He would be happy with whatever came by the Lord's arrangement. When guests would come to his home, without a second thought, he would give them everything in charity. Sometimes when he donated everything he had, he and his family would fast for days because of no food! Once, Rantideva fasted for forty-eight days. Then, on the forty-ninth morning, he was about to break his fast with little food made with milk and ghee. Then, a br\u0101hma\u0146a guest arrived. Seeing the Lord within every living being, Rantideva received the guest respectfully and gave him a share of his food. Pleased with Rantideva's offering, the brahmana ate the food happily and went away. After that, Rantideva split the remaining food among his family members. As he was just about to eat his share, a poor beggar arrived. Considering him also to be a child of God, Rantideva gave him another share of his food. Rantideva knew that everyone is a child of God, whether a br\u0101hma\u0146a or a beggar, poor or rich. When the beggar went away, another guest came, surrounded by dogs, and said, O King, I and my dogs are very hungry. Can you give us something to eat? Without any hesitation, Rantideva offered the balance of his food to the dogs and the master of the dogs. Thus, he exhibited great patience and tolerance. By then, only little drinking water was remaining. Even that water was enough only to satisfy one person. When Rantideva was about to drink that water, a weak and fatigued man came. Struggling to maintain his life, he begged desperately, O King, kindly give me some drinking water. I am on the verge of falling unconscious. Rantideva felt pity for him, and offered a prayer to the Lord, O Lord, I am unable to see the suffering of these people. Please free them from all miseries. I am willing to suffer on their behalf. I am freed from all hunger, thirst, and fatigue by offering my water to maintain this poor man's life, who is struggling to live. Rantideva, although on the verge of death due to fasting for forty-eight days, gave his water to that poor man. The man was thus satisfied. All the people who had come to Rantideva to beg for food and water were the devas, including Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva. They had come to test Rantideva, who wonderfully passed the test. Brahma and Shiva then revealed their real forms. Rantideva became extremely happy and bowed in front of the devas, who blessed him. The Lord wants to reveal their greatness to all of us by putting noble devotees through such tests. By the example of Rantideva, we understand that all living beings are children of God and must be treated equally.",
